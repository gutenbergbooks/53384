<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Committee who organised the late expedition to
Dutch New Guinea, paid me the high compliment of
inviting me to write an account of our doings in that
country. The fact that it is, in a sense, the official
account of the expedition has precluded me—greatly
to the advantage of the reader—from offering my own
views on the things that we saw and on things in
general. The country that we visited was quite unknown
to Europeans, and the native races with whom we came
in contact were living in so primitive a state that the
second title of this book is literally true. The pygmies
are indeed one of the most primitive peoples now in
existence.</p>

<p>Should any find this account lacking in thrilling
adventure, I will quote the words of a famous navigator,
who visited the coasts of New Guinea more than two
hundred years ago:—“It has been Objected against me
by some, that my Accounts and Descriptions of Things
are dry and jejune, not filled with variety of pleasant
Matter, to divert and gratify the Curious Reader. How
far this is true, I must leave to the World to judge.
But if I have been exactly and strictly careful to give
only <i>True</i> Relations and Descriptions of Things (as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
am sure I have;) and if my Descriptions be such as
may be of use not only to myself, but also to others
in future Voyages; and likewise to such readers at home
as are desirous of a Plain and Just Account of the true
Nature and State of the Things described, than of a
Polite and Rhetorical Narrative: I hope all the Defects
in my Stile will meet with an easy and ready Pardon.”</p>

<p>To Dr. Alfred Russel Wallace, who has allowed me
to inscribe this volume to him as a small token of
admiration for the first and greatest of the Naturalists
who visited New Guinea, my most sincere thanks are
due.</p>

<p>To Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, Dr. A. C. Haddon, and
Mr. Sidney Ray, who have not only assisted me with
advice but have contributed the three most valuable
articles at the end of this volume, I can only repeat my
thanks, which have been expressed elsewhere.</p>

<p>To my fellow-members of the expedition I would like
to wish further voyages in more propitious climates.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wonderful fauna of New Guinea, especially the
marvellous forms of Bird- and Insect-life to be found there,
have long attracted the attention of naturalists in all parts
of the world. The exploration of this vast island during
recent years has brought to light many extraordinary and
hitherto unknown forms, more particularly new Birds of
Paradise and Gardener Bower-Birds; but until recently the
central portion was still entirely unexplored, though no
part of the globe promised to yield such an abundance
of zoological treasures to those prepared to face
the difficulties of penetrating to the great ranges of the
interior.</p>

<p>The B.O.U. Expedition, of which the present work
is the official record, originated in the following manner.
For many years past I had been trying to organise an
exploration of the Snow Mountains, but the reported
hostility of the natives in the southern part of Dutch
New Guinea and the risks attending such an undertaking,
rendered the chances of success too small to justify the
attempt.</p>

<p>It was in 1907 that Mr. Walter Goodfellow, well-known
as an experienced traveller and an accomplished
naturalist, informed me that he believed a properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
equipped expedition might meet with success, and I
entered into an arrangement with him to lead a small
zoological expedition to explore the Snow Mountains. It
so happened, however, that by the time our arrangements
had been completed in December, 1908, the members of
the British Ornithologists’ Union, founded in 1858, were
celebrating their Jubilee, and it seemed fitting that they
should mark so memorable an occasion by undertaking some
great zoological exploration. I therefore laid my scheme
for exploring the Snow Mountains before the meeting,
and suggested that it should be known as the Jubilee
Expedition of the B.O.U., a proposal which was received
with enthusiasm. A Committee was formed, consisting of
Mr. F. du Cane Godman, F.R.S. (President of the
B.O.U.), Dr. P. L. Sclater, F.R.S. (Editor of the <i>Ibis</i>),
Mr. E. G. B. Meade-Waldo, Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Grant
(Secretary), and Mr. C. E. Fagan (Treasurer). At the
request of the Royal Geographical Society it was decided
that their interests should also be represented, and that a
surveyor and an assistant-surveyor, to be selected by the
Committee, should be added, the Society undertaking to
contribute funds for that purpose. The expedition thus
became a much larger one than had been originally contemplated
and included:—</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="indent2">Mr. Walter Goodfellow (Leader),</p>

<p class="indent2">Mr. Wilfred Stalker and Mr. Guy C. Shortridge (Collectors
of Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, etc.),</p>

<p class="indent2">Mr. A. F. R. Wollaston (Medical Officer to the Expedition,
Entomologist, and Botanist),</p>

<p class="indent2">Capt. C. G. Rawling, C.I.E. (Surveyor),</p>

<p class="indent2">Dr. Eric Marshall (Assistant-Surveyor and Surgeon).</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span></p>

<p>To meet the cost of keeping such an expedition in the
field for at least a year it was necessary to raise a large
sum of money, and this I was eventually able to do, thanks
chiefly to a liberal grant from His Majesty’s Government,
and to the generosity of a number of private subscribers,
many of whom were members of the B.O.U.
The total sum raised amounted to over £9000, and
though it is impossible to give here the names of
all those who contributed, I would especially mention the
following:—</p>

<p>The organization and equipment of this large expedition
caused considerable delay and it was not until
September, 1909, that the members sailed from England for
the East. Meanwhile the necessary steps were taken to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
obtain the consent of the Netherlands Government to
allow the proposed expedition to travel in Dutch New
Guinea and to carry out the scheme of exploration. Not
only was this permission granted, thanks to the kindly
help of Sir Edward Grey and the British Minister at the
Hague, but the Government of Holland showed itself
animated with such readiness to assist the expedition
that it supplied not only an armed guard at its own
expense, but placed a gunboat at the disposal of the
Committee to convey the party from Batavia to New
Guinea.</p>

<p>On behalf of the Committee I would again take this
opportunity of publicly expressing their most grateful
thanks to the Netherlands Government for these and many
other substantial acts of kindness, which were shown to
the members of the expedition. The Peninsular and
Oriental Steam Navigation Company did all in their
power to further the interests of the expedition, and to
them the Committee is very specially indebted. To the
proprietors of <i>Country Life</i> the thanks of the Committee
are also due for the interest and sympathy they
have displayed towards the expedition and for the assistance
they have given in helping to raise funds to carry
on the work in the field.</p>

<p>In various numbers of <i>Country Life</i>, issued between
the 16th of April, 1910, and the 20th of May, 1911, a
series of ten articles will be found in which I contributed
a general account of New Guinea, and mentioned some
of the more important discoveries made by the members
of the expedition during their attempts to penetrate to
the Snow Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span></p>

<p>In Appendix A to the present volume will be found
a general account of the ornithological results. A detailed
report will appear elsewhere, as also, it is hoped, a
complete account of the zoological work done by the
expedition.</p>

<p>As the reader will learn from Mr. Wollaston’s book,
the great physical difficulties of this unexplored part of
New Guinea and other unforeseen circumstances rendered
the work of the B.O.U. Expedition quite exceptionally
arduous; and if the results of their exploration are not all
that had been hoped, it must be remembered that they
did all that was humanly possible to carry out the
dangerous task with which they had been entrusted.
Their work has added vastly to our knowledge of this
part of New Guinea, and though little collecting was
done above 4000 feet, quite a number of new, and,
in many cases, remarkably interesting forms were
obtained.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that when the higher ranges
between 5000 and 10,000 feet are explored, many other
novelties will be discovered and for this reason it has
been thought advisable to postpone the publication of
the scientific results of the B.O.U. Expedition until such
time as the second expedition under Mr. Wollaston has
returned in 1913.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Wilfred Stalker at a very early
period of the expedition was a sad misfortune and his
services could ill be spared; his place was, however, very
ably filled by Mr. Claude H. B. Grant, who arrived in
New Guinea some six months later.</p>

<p>As all those who have served on committees must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
know, most of the work falls on one or two individuals,
and I should like here to express the thanks which we owe
to our Treasurer, Mr. C. E. Fagan, for the admirable
way in which he has carried out his very difficult task.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the autumn of 1858 a small party of naturalists, most
of them members of the University of Cambridge and
their friends and all of them interested in the study of
ornithology, met in the rooms of the late Professor Alfred
Newton at Magdalene College, Cambridge, and agreed to
found a society with the principal object of producing a
quarterly Journal of general ornithology. The Journal
was called “The Ibis,” and the Society adopted the name
of British Ornithologists’ Union, the number of members
being originally limited to twenty.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1908 the Society, which by that
time counted four hundred and seventy members, adopted
the suggestion, made by Mr. W. R. Ogilvie-Grant, of
celebrating its jubilee by sending an expedition to explore,
chiefly from an ornithological point of view, the unknown
range of Snow Mountains in Dutch New Guinea. A
Committee, whose Chairman was Mr. F. D. Godman,
F.R.S., President and one of the surviving original
members of the Society, was appointed to organise the
expedition, and subscriptions were obtained from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
members and their friends. The remote destination of
the expedition aroused a good deal of public interest.
The Royal Geographical Society expressed a desire to
share in the enterprise, and it soon became evident that
it would be a mistake to limit the object of the expedition
to the pursuit of birds only. Mr. Walter Goodfellow, a
naturalist who had several times travelled in New Guinea
as well as in other parts of the world, was appointed
leader of the expedition. Mr. W. Stalker and Mr. G. C.
Shortridge, both of whom had had wide experience of
collecting in the East, were appointed naturalists. Capt.
C. G. Rawling, C.I.E., 13th Somersetshire Light Infantry,
who had travelled widely in Tibet and mapped a large
area of unknown territory in that region, was appointed
surveyor, with Mr. E. S. Marshall, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.,
who had just returned from the “Furthest South” with
Sir E. H. Shackleton, as assistant surveyor and surgeon;
and the present writer, who had been medical officer,
botanist, and entomologist on the Ruwenzori Expedition
of 1906-7, undertook the same duties as before.</p>

<p>Prolonged correspondence between the Foreign Office
and the Dutch Government resulted, thanks largely to
the personal interest of Sir Edward Grey and Lord
Acton, British Chargé d’Affaires at the Hague, in permission
being granted to the expedition to land in Dutch
New Guinea on or after January 1, 1910. The date
of landing was postponed by the Government until
January in order that there might be no interference
with the expedition of Mr. H. A. Lorentz, who it was
hoped would be the first to reach the snow in New
Guinea by way of the Noord River, a project which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
successfully accomplished in the month of November,
1909.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VOYAGE TO JAVA</div>

<p>On October 29th four of us sailed from Marseilles in
the P. &amp; O. <span class="smcap">S.S.</span> <i>Marmora</i>. Mr. Stalker and Mr. Shortridge,
who had already proceeded to the East, joined us
later at Batavia and Amboina respectively. At Singapore
we found the ten Gurkhas, ex-military police, who
had been engaged for the expedition by the recruiting
officer at Darjiling; though some of these men were
useless for the work they had to do, the others did invaluable
service as will be seen later. We left Singapore
on November 26th, and as we passed through the narrow
Riou Straits we saw the remains of the French mail
steamer <i>La Seyne</i>, which had been wrecked there with
appalling loss of life a few days earlier. It was believed
that scores of persons were devoured by sharks within
a few minutes of the accident happening. Two days’
steaming in the Dutch packet brought us to Batavia
in Java, the city of the Government of the Netherlands
East Indies.</p>

<p>We had hoped that our ten Gurkhas would be sufficient
escort for the expedition and that we could do
without the escort of native soldiers offered to us by the
Dutch Government, but the local authorities decided
that the escort was necessary and they appointed to
command it Lieutenant H. A. Cramer of the Infantry,
a probationer on the Staff of the Dutch East Indian
Army. The Government also undertook to transport
the whole expedition, men, stores, and equipment, from
Java to New Guinea. The undertaking was a most
generous one as the voyage from Batavia by mail steamer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
to Dobo in the Aru Islands would have been most costly,
and from there we should have been obliged to charter
a special steamer to convey the expedition to the shores
of New Guinea.</p>

<p>When we left England we had the intention of approaching
the Snow Mountains by way of the Utakwa
River, which was the only river shown by the maps
obtainable at that time approaching the mountains.
After a consultation with the Military and Geographical
Departments at Batavia it was decided that, owing to
the bad accounts which had been received of the Utakwa
River and the comparatively favourable reports of the
Mimika River, the latter should be chosen as the point
of our entry into the country. This decision, though we
little suspected it at the time, effectually put an end to
our chance of reaching the Snow Mountains.</p>

<p>During the month of December, while stores were
being accumulated, and the steamer was being prepared
for our use, we had leisure to visit, and in the case of
some of us to revisit, some of the most interesting places
in Java. A large German ship filled with fourteen
hundred American tourists arrived at Batavia whilst we
were there, and the passengers “did” Java, apparently
to their satisfaction, in forty-eight hours. But a tourist
with more time could find occupation for as many days
and still leave much to be seen. Germans and Americans
outnumber English visitors by nearly fifty to one, and
it is to be deplored that Englishmen do not go there in
larger numbers, for they would see in Java, not to mention
the beauty of its scenery, perhaps the most successful
tropical dependency in the world, a vast monument to
the genius of Sir Stamford Raffles, who laid the foundation
of its prosperity less than one hundred years ago.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">PROSPERITY OF JAVA</div>

<p>Some idea of the progress which has been made may
be learnt from the fact that, whereas at the beginning
of the last century the population numbered about four
millions, there are to-day nearly ten times that number.
Wherever you go you see excellent roads, clean, and
well-ordered villages and a swarming peasant population,
quiet and industrious and apparently contented with
their lot.</p>

<p>There are between thirty and forty volcanoes in the
island, many of them active, and the soil is extraordinarily
rich and productive, three crops in the rice
districts being harvested in rather less than two years.
So fertile is the land that in many places the steepest
slopes of the hills have been brought under cultivation
by an ingenious system of terracing and irrigation in
such a way that the higher valleys present the appearance
of great amphitheatres rising tier above tier of
brilliantly green young rice plants or of drooping yellow
heads of ripening grain. The tea plantations and the
fields of sugar-cane in Central Java not less than the
rice-growing districts impress one with the unceasing
industry of the people and the inexhaustible wealth of
the island.</p>

<p>One of the features of life in the Dutch East Indies,
which first strikes the attention of an English visitor, is
the difference in the relation between Europeans and
natives from those which usually obtain in British
possessions as shown by the enormous number of half-castes.
Whilst we were still at Batavia the feast of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Eve of St. Nicholas, which takes the place of our Christmas,
occurred. In the evening the entire “white” population
indulged in a sort of carnival; the main streets
and restaurants were crowded, bands played and carriages
laden with parents and their children drove slowly
through the throng. The spectacle, a sort of “trooping
of the colours,” was a most interesting one to the onlooker,
for one saw often in the same family children
showing every degree of colour from the fairest Dutch
hair and complexion to the darkest Javanese. It is
easy to understand how this strong mixture of races has
come about, when one learns that Dutchmen who come
out to the East Indies, whether as civilian or military
officials or as business men, almost invariably stay for
ten years without returning to Europe. They become
in that time more firmly attached to the country than is
the case in colonies where people go home at shorter
intervals, and it is not uncommon to meet Dutchmen
who have not returned to Holland for thirty or forty
years. It is not the custom to send children back to
Europe when they reach the school age; there are
excellent government schools in all the larger towns,
and it often happens that men and women grow up and
marry who have never been to Europe in their lives.
Thus it can be seen how a large half-caste population is
likely to be formed. The half-castes do not, as in British
India, form a separate caste, but are regarded as Europeans,
and there are many instances of men having more
or less of native blood in their veins reaching the highest
civilian and military rank.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote">THE RIJST-TAFEL</div>

<p>One or two curious relics of former times, which the
visitor to Java notices, are worth recording because they
show the survival of a spirit that has almost completely
disappeared from our own dominions. When a European
walks, or as is more usual, drives along the country
roads, the natives whom he meets remove their hats
from their heads and their loads from their shoulders and
crouch humbly by the roadside. Again, on the railways
the ticket examiner approaches with a suppliant air
and begs to see your ticket, while he holds out his right
hand for it grasping his right wrist with his left hand.
In former times when a man held out his right hand to
give or take something from you his left hand was free
to stab you with his <i>kris</i>. Nowadays only a very few
privileged natives in Java are allowed to carry the
<i>kris</i>.</p>

<p>Another very noticeable feature of life in the Dutch
East Indies, which immediately attracts the attention of
a stranger, is the astonishing number of excessively
corpulent Europeans. If you travel in the morning in
the steam tramcar which runs from the residential part
of Batavia to the business quarter of the town, you will
see as many noticeably stout men as you will see in
the City of London in a year, or, as I was credibly
informed, as you will see in the city of Amsterdam in a
month. It is fairly certain that this unhealthy state of
body of a large number of Europeans may be attributed
to the institution of the Rijst-tafel, the midday meal
of a large majority of the Dutchmen in the East.</p>

<p>This custom is so remarkable that it is worth while
to give a description of it. The foundation of the meal,
as its name implies, is rice. You sit at table with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
soup plate in front of you, a smaller flat plate beside it
and a spoon, a knife and a fork. The first servant brings
a large bowl of rice from which you help yourself liberally.
The second brings a kind of vegetable stew which you
pour over the heap of rice. Then follows a remarkable
procession; I have myself seen at an hotel in Batavia
fourteen different boys bringing as many different dishes,
and I have seen stalwart Teutons taking samples from
every dish. These boys bring fish of various sorts and
of various cookeries, bones of chickens cooked in different
ways and eggs of various ages, and last of all comes a
boy bearing a large tray covered with many different
kinds of chutneys and sauces from which the connoisseur
chooses three or four. The more solid and bony portions
find a space on the small flat plate, the others are piled
in the soup plate upon the rice. As an experience once
or twice the Rijst-tafel is interesting; but as a daily
custom it is an abomination. Even when, as in private
houses, the number of dishes is perhaps not more than
three or four, the main foundation of the meal is a solid
pile of rice, which is not at all a satisfactory diet for
Europeans. The Rijst-tafel is not a traditional native
custom but a modern innovation, and there is a tendency
among the more active members of the community to
replace it by a more rational meal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUSTOMS OF THE DUTCH</div>

<p>The houses of the Europeans are of the bungalow type
with high-pitched roofs of red tiles and surrounded by
wide verandahs, which are actually the living rooms of
the house. The Dutch are good gardeners and are
particularly fond of trees, which they plant close about
their houses and so ensure a pleasant shade, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
they harbour rather more mosquitoes and other insects
than is pleasant. In strange contrast with the scrupulous
cleanliness of the houses and the tidiness of the streets,
you will see in Batavia a state of things which it is hard
to reconcile with the usual commonsense of the Dutch.
Through the middle of the town runs a canalised river
of red muddy water, partly sewer and partly bathing
place and so on of the natives, and in it are washed all
the clothes of the population, both native and European.
Your clothes return to you white enough, but you put
them on with certain qualms when you remember whence
they came. The town has an excellent supply of pure
water, and it is astonishing that the authorities do not
put an end to this most insanitary practice.</p>

<p>Dutch people in the East Indies have modified their
habits, especially in the matter of clothing, to suit the
requirements of the climate, and while they have to some
extent sacrificed elegance to comfort, their costume is
at all events more rational than that of many Englishmen
in the East, who cling too affectionately to the
fashions of Europe and often wear too much clothing.
The men, who do the greater part of the day’s work
between seven in the morning and one o’clock, wear a
plain white suit of cotton or linen. The afternoon is
spent in taking a siesta and at about five o’clock they go
to their clubs or other amusements in the same sort of
attire as in the morning. The ladies, except in the
larger towns where European dress is the custom, appear
in public during the greater part of the day in a curiously
simple costume. The upper part of the body is clothed
in a short white cotton jacket, below which the coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
native <i>sarong</i> extends midway down the leg. Low
slippers are worn on bare feet, the hair hangs undressed
down the back and the costume is usually completed
by an umbrella. It must be admitted that the effect
is not ornamental, but the costume is doubtless cool and
comfortable, and it prevents any risk there might be
of injury to the health from wearing an excessive amount
of clothing. They appear more conventionally dressed
about five o’clock, when the social business of the day
begins. The ladies pay calls while the men meet at the
club and play cards until an uncomfortably late dinner
at about nine o’clock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOTANIC GARDEN</div>

<p>About an hour’s journey by railway from Batavia
is the hill station of Buitenzorg. Although it is hardly
more than eight hundred feet above the sea the climate
is noticeably cooler (the mean annual temperature is
75°), and one feels immediately more vigorous than
down in the low country. The palace of the Governor
General, formerly the house of Sir Stamford Raffles,
stands at the edge of the Botanic Garden, which alone,
even if you saw nothing else, would justify a visit to
Java. Plants from all the Tropics grow there in the
best possible conditions, and you see them to advantage
as you never can in their natural forest surroundings,
where the trunks of the trees are obscured by a tangle
of undergrowth. Every part of the garden is worth
exploring, but one of the most curious and interesting
sections is the collection of Screw-pines (<i>Pandanus</i>)
and Cycads, which have a weirdly antediluvian appearance.
Another very beautiful sight is the ponds of
Water-lilies from different parts of the world. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
native gardener in charge of them informed me that the
different species have different and definite hours for
the opening and closing of their flowers. I tested his
statement in two instances and found the flowers almost
exactly punctual. There was no cloud in the sky nor
appearance of any change in the weather, and the reason
for this behaviour is not easy to explain. At Sindanglaya
in the mountains a few miles distant is an offshoot from
the Buitenzorg garden, where plants of a more temperate
climate flourish, and experiments are made on plants
of economic value to the country.</p>

<p>A few hours’ journey east from Buitenzorg is Garoet
(2,300 feet above the sea), which lies in a beautiful fertile
valley surrounded by forest-covered mountains. The
climate is an almost ideal one, the nights are cool and the
days are not too hot. A very remarkable feature of
the country about Garoet is the great flocks, or rather
droves, of ducks which you meet being driven along
the roads from the villages to their pastures in the
rice fields. These ducks differ from the ordinary domestic
duck in their extraordinary erect attitude, from which
they have been well called Penguin ducks. Whether
their upright posture is due to their walking or not I
do not know, but they are excellent walkers and are
sometimes driven long distances to their feeding grounds.
When a duck is tired and lags behind, the boy who
herds them picks it up by the neck, and you may sometimes
see him walking along with a bunch of two or
three ducks in either hand.</p>

<p>Others of our party visited Djokjakarta and the
Buddhist Temples of Boro-Boder in Central Java and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
mountain resort of Tosari in the volcanic region of
Eastern Java. Tosari is more than five thousand feet
above the sea, and is of great value to the Dutch as a
sanatorium for soldiers and civilians from all parts of
the Archipelago. The rainfall is comparatively scanty
and the climate is like that of Southern Europe at its
best.</p>

<p><i>Expedition leaves Java—The “Nias”—Escort—Macassar—Raja of
Goa—Amboina—Corals and Fishes—Ambonese Christians—Dutch
Clubs—Dobo.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> December 21st we left Batavia, and on Christmas
Day, 1909, we sailed from Soerabaja in the Government
steamer <i>Nias</i>, Capt. Hondius van Herwerden. The
<i>Nias</i>, a ship of about six hundred tons, formerly a gun-boat
in the Netherlands Indies Marine, is now stripped
of her two small guns and is used by the Government
as a special service vessel. Her last commission before
embarking us has been to transport Mr. Lorentz on his
expedition to the Noord River in New Guinea three
months earlier. Now she was full to the brim of stores
and gear of all sorts and her decks were crowded with
men. There were five of us and ten Gurkhas. The
Dutch escort consisted of Lieutenant H. A. Cramer in
command, two Dutch sergeants and one Dutch medical
orderly, forty native Javanese soldiers and sixty
convicts, most of them Javanese. The convicts were
nearly all of them men with more or less long
sentences of imprisonment and some of them were
murderers in chains, which were knocked off them
to their great relief the day after we left Soerabaja.
One of the best of the convicts, a native of Bali, was
a murderer (see illustration, page 12), who did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
admirable service to the expedition, and was subsequently
promoted to be <i>mandoer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>At Macassar we stopped a few hours only to add to
our already excessive deck cargo, and to hear a little
of the gossip of Celebes. I was interested to learn that
the power of the Raja of Goa, whom I had visited a
few years before, had come to an end. That monarch
was an interesting survivor of the old native princes
of the island. His kingdom extended to within three
miles of Macassar, and he was apparently not answerable
to any law or authority but his own. The place became
a refuge for criminals fleeing from justice, and it was
a disagreeable thorn in the side of the Dutch authorities,
who were at last compelled to send a small expedition
to annex the country. The Raja himself, it was said,
came to a very unpleasant end in a ditch.</p>

<p>There had also been a small war on the east side of
the island, which resulted in the pacification of the large
and prosperous district of Boni. Now the Island of
Celebes, which only a few years ago was dominated by
savage tribes and where it was unsafe for an European
to travel, has been almost completely brought within
the Dutch administration, and it seems likely that its
enormous mineral and agricultural wealth will soon
make it one of the most prosperous islands of the
Archipelago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AMBOINA</div>

<p>On December 30th we anchored in the harbour of
Amboina, where we were joined by the last member
of the expedition, Mr. W. Stalker, who had been for
some months collecting birds in Ceram, and recently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>had been engaged in Amboina in recruiting coolies for
the expedition. It had been expected that he would
go to engage coolies in the Ké Islands, a group of islands
about three hundred miles to the south-east of Amboina,
where the natives are more sturdy and less sophisticated
than the people of Amboina; but circumstances had
prevented him from going there, and we had to put up
with the very inferior Ambonese, a fact which at the
outset seriously handicapped the expedition. We stayed
for two days at Amboina, or, as the Dutch always call
it, Ambon, buying necessary stores and making arrangements
with the Dutch authorities, who agreed to send
a steamer every two months, if the weather were favourable,
to bring men and further supplies to us in New
Guinea.</p>

<p>Amboina is an exceedingly pretty place, and a very
favourite station of the Dutch on account of its climate,
which is remarkably equable, and its freedom from
strong winds or excessive rain. There is a volcano at
the north end of the island which has slumbered since
1824, and the place is very subject to earthquakes. A
very serious one occurred as recently as 1902, which
destroyed hundreds of lives and houses, whose walls
may still be seen lying flat in the gardens, but as in other
volcanic places the inhabitants have conveniently short
memories, and the place has been re-built ready for
another visitation.</p>

<p>Like most of the other Dutch settlements in the
East, Amboina has been laid out on a rectangular plan,
but the uniformity of the arrangement is saved from
being monotonous by the tree-planting habits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Dutch. The roads and open spaces are shaded by
Kanari trees, which also produce a most delicious nut,
and the gardens are hedged with flowering Hibiscus and
Oleander and gaudy-leafed Crotons. Roses, as well as
many other temperate plants, in addition to “hothouse”
plants, flourish in the gardens, and the verandahs
of the houses themselves are often decorated with
orchids from Ceram and the Tenimber Islands. Birds
are not common in the town itself except in captivity,
and you see, especially in the gardens of the natives’
houses, parrots and lories, and pigeons from the Moluccas
and New Guinea, and you may even hear the call of the
Greater bird of paradise. Attracted by the many
flowering plants are swarms of butterflies, some of them
of great beauty. One of the most gorgeous of these is
the large blue <i>Papilio ulysses</i>, which floats from flower
to flower like a piece of living blue sky.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE AMBONESE</div>

<p>The harbour of Amboina is a wide deep channel,
which nearly divides the island into two, and in it are
the wonderful sea-gardens, which aroused the enthusiasm
of Mr. Wallace.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> They are not perhaps so wonderful
as the sea-gardens at Banda and elsewhere, but to those
who have never seen such things before the many
coloured sea-weeds and corals and shells and shoals of
fantastic fishes seen through crystal water are a source
of unfailing interest. The sea is crowded with fish of
every size and form and colour. Nearly eight hundred
species have been described from Ambonese waters,
and it is worth while to visit the market in the early
morning, when the night’s haul is brought in, and before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>the very evanescent colours of the fish have faded.
Nearly every man in the place is a fisherman during
some part of the day or night, and nobody need starve
who has the energy to throw a baited hook into the
sea. Most of the fish are caught either in nets very
similar to our seine-net or in more elaborate traps
which are mostly constructed by Chinamen.</p>

<p>The market is also worth visiting to see the variety
of fruit and spices that grow in the island. Amboina
has a peculiar form of banana, the <i>Pisang Ambon</i>, with
white flesh, dark green skin, and a very peculiar flavour.
Besides this there are many other kinds of bananas,
mangoes, mangostines, guavas, sour-manilla, soursop,
pineapples, kanari nut, nutmeg, cloves, and a small but
very delicious fruit, the garnderia.</p>

<p>The native inhabitants of Amboina are a curious
mixture of the aboriginal native with Portuguese, Dutch,
and Malay blood. There is a strong predominance of
the Portuguese type, which shows itself in the faces of
many of the people, who still use words of Portuguese
origin, and preserve many Portuguese names. A large
number of them are Christians, and they rejoice in such
names as Josef, Esau, Jacob, Petrus and Domingos.</p>

<p>New Year’s Eve was celebrated by a confusion of
fireworks and gun-firing, which lasted from sunset
until the small hours of 1910, and by an afternoon
service in the Church attended by many hundreds of
people. The women, who are usually in Amboina
dressed entirely in black, wore for the occasion long
white coats, black <i>sarongs</i> and white stockings. The
men went more variously clad in straw hats, dinner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
jackets, low waistcoats, white or coloured starched
shirts, coloured ties, black trousers, and brown boots.
We were interested to find that the great bulk of the
stuff from which clothes are made in Amboina is imported
from England, and we were assured by a merchant
who was interested in the trade that a man can dress
himself in so-called European fashion as cheaply in
Amboina as he can in this country.</p>

<p>An agreeable feature of life at Amboina, as at other
places in the Netherlands Indies, is the hospitality of
the Dutch people. A stranger of at all respectable
social position is expected to introduce himself to the
club, and the residents in the place feel genuinely hurt
if he fails to do so. The Societat, or “Soce,” as it is
everywhere called, is more of a café than a club according
to English ideas, and it exists for conviviality and
gossiping rather than for newspaper reading and card
playing. It is not even a restaurant in the sense that
many English clubs are; the members meet there in
the evening but they invariably dine, as they lunch,
at home. On the verandah in front of the club is a
round table, at which sit after dark large men in white
clothes smoking cigars and drinking various drinks.
The foreigner approaches with what courage he may
and introduces himself by name to the party severally.
They make a place for him in the circle and thereafter,
with a courtesy which a group of Englishmen
would find difficulty in imitating, they continue the
conversation in the language of the foreigner. An
Englishman is at first a little staggered by the number
of <i>pait</i> (<i>i.e.</i> bitter, the name for gin and bitters) and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
other drinks that his hosts consume, and which he is
expected to consume also, but, as I remember noticing
in the case of their neighbours the Belgians in the Congo,
it appears to do them little if any harm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARAFURA SEA</div>

<p>In the larger places there is a concert at the club
once or twice a week—at Bandoeng in Java I heard
a remarkably good string quartette—and in almost
every place there is a ladies’ night at the club once a
week, when the children come to dance to the music
of a piano or gramophone, as the case may be. It is
a pretty sight and one to make one ponder on the possible
harmony of nations—“Harmonie” is commonly a name
for the clubs in the Netherlands Indies—to see small Dutch
children dancing with little half-castes and, as I have
more than once seen, with little Celestials and Japanese.</p>

<p>We left Amboina on New Year’s Day in a deluge of
rain, and all that day we were in sight of the forest-covered
heights of Ceram to the North. On January
2nd we passed Banda at dawn, and at sunset we got a
view of the most South-west point of New Guinea,
Cape Van de Bosch. On the morning of January 3rd
we dropped anchor in the harbour of Dobo in the Aru
Islands. For several miles before we arrived there we
had noticed a marked difference in the appearance of
the sea. Since we left Batavia we had been sailing
over a deep sea of great oceanic depths, sometimes of
two or three thousand fathoms, which was always clear
and blue or black as deep seas are. Approaching the
Aru Islands we came into the shoal waters of the Arafura
Sea, which is yellowish and opaque and never exceeds
one hundred fathoms in depth. We were, in fact, sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
over that scarcely submerged land, which joins the Aru
Islands and New Guinea with the Continent of Australia.</p>

<p>Dobo has doubtless changed a good deal in appearance
since Mr. Wallace visited it in 1857, the majority
of the houses are now built of corrugated iron in place
of the palm leaves of fifty years ago; but it cannot
have increased greatly in size, for it is built on a small
spit of coral sand beyond which are mangrove swamps
where building is impossible. The reason of its existence
has also changed since the time when it was the
great market of all the neighbouring islands, for now
it exists solely as the centre of a pearl-fishing industry
controlled by an Australian Company, the Celebes
Trading Company. Messrs. Clarke &amp; Ross Smith, the
heads of this business, rendered us assistance in very
many ways, and the sincerest thanks of the expedition
are due to them. The primary object of pearl-fishing
is of course the collection of pearl-shell which is used for
knife handles, buttons, and a hundred other things.
Shell of a good quality is worth more than £200 a ton.
The pearls, which are occasionally found, are merely
accidentals and profitable extras of the trade. Some
idea of the extent of this business may be learnt from the
fact that more than one hundred boats employing about
five thousand men are occupied in the various fleets.</p>

<p>We left Dobo, the last place of civilisation that many
of us were to see for a year and more, on January 3rd;
and here, as we are almost within sight as it were of our
destination, it may be opportune to state briefly the
geographical position of New Guinea, and to give a short
account of its exploration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> island of New Guinea or Papua lies to the East
of all the great islands of the Malay Archipelago and
forms a barrier between them and the Pacific Ocean.
To the South of it lies the Continent of Australia
separated from it by the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait,
which at its narrowest point is less than a hundred
miles wide. To the East is the great group of the
Solomon Islands, while on the North there are no important
masses of land between New Guinea and Japan.
The island lies wholly to the South of the Equator,
its most Northern point, the Cape of Good Hope in
the Arfak Peninsula, being 19´ S. latitude.</p>

<p>The extreme length of the island from E. to W. is
1490 miles, and its greatest breadth from N. to S. is
rather more than 400 miles. New Guinea is the largest
of the islands of the globe, having an area of 308,000
square miles (Borneo has about 290,000 square miles),
and it is divided amongst three countries roughly as
follows: Holland 150,000, Great Britain 90,000, and
Germany 70,000 square miles. The large territory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the Dutch was acquired by them with the kingdom of
the Sultan of Ternate, who was accustomed to claim
Western New Guinea as a part of his dominions: it is
bounded on the East by the 141st parallel of East
longitude and partly by the Fly River and thus it
comprises nearly a half of the island.</p>

<p>The Eastern half of the island is divided into a
Northern, German, and a Southern, British, part. The
German territory is called Kaiser Wilhelm Land, and
the islands adjacent to it, which have received German
substitutes for their old names of New Britain, New
Ireland, etc., are known as the Bismarck Archipelago.
British New Guinea, which is now administered by the
Federal Government of Australia, has been officially
renamed the Territory of Papua, and with it are included
the numerous islands at its Eastern extremity, the
D’Entrecasteaux and Louisiade Archipelagoes.</p>

<p>Only in the British territory has a serious attempt
been made at settling and administering the country;
the headquarters of the Government are at Port Moresby,
and the country is divided into six magisterial districts.</p>

<p>The German possessions are governed from Herbertshöhe
in Neu Pommern (New Britain), which is the
centre of a small amount of island trade, but the settlements
on the New Guinea mainland are few and far
between, and it cannot be pretended that the country
is German except in name.</p>

<p>The Dutch territory has been even less brought under
control than the German. For more than half a century
there has been a mission station at Dorei in the N.W.
but until 1899 when the Dutch assumed the direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
control of the country, which was till that time nominally
governed by the Sultan of Tidor (Ternate), there was
no sign of Dutch rule in New Guinea. Now there are
Government stations with small bodies of native soldiers
at Manokware, an island in Dorei Bay, and at Fak-fak
on the shore of MacCluer Gulf; more recently a third
post has been established at Merauke on the South
coast near the boundary of British New Guinea, with
the object of subjugating the fierce Tugere tribe of
that region.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN RANGES</div>

<p>The most important physical feature of New Guinea
is the great system of mountain ranges, which run from
West to East and form the back-bone of the island.
The Arfak Peninsula in the N.W. is made entirely by
mountains which reach an altitude of more than 9000
feet. In the great central mass of the island the
mountains begin near the S.W. coast with the Charles
Louis Mountains, which vary in height from 4000 to
9000 feet. Following these to the East they are found
to be continuous with the Snowy Mountains (now called
the Nassau Range, the objective of this expedition)
which culminate in the glacier-covered tops of Mount
Idenberg (15,379 feet), and Mount Carstensz (15,964 feet),
and to the East of these is the snow-capped Mount
Wilhelmina (15,420 feet), and Mount Juliana (about
14,764 feet).</p>

<p>Leaving Dutch New Guinea and proceeding further
to the East we come to the Victor Emmanuel and the
Sir Arthur Gordon Ranges, which lie near the boundary
of German and British New Guinea. Still further East
is the Bismarck Range, often snow covered, and extending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
through the long Eastern prolongation of the island
are the great range of the Owen Stanley Mountains,
which reach their highest point in Mount Victoria
(13,150 feet), and the Stirling Range.</p>

<p>As might be expected in so mountainous a country
there is a large number of rivers and some of them are
of great size. On the North coast the Kaiserin Augusta
River rises in Dutch territory and takes an almost
Easterly course through German New Guinea to the
sea, while the Amberno (or Mamberamo) rises probably
from the slopes of the Snowy Mountains and
flows Northwards to Point d’Urville. On the South
coast, in British New Guinea besides the Purari, Kikor
and Turama Rivers, the most important is the Fly River,
which has been explored by boat for a distance of more
than five hundred miles. In Southern Dutch New
Guinea there are almost countless rivers: chief among
them are the Digoel, which has been explored for more
than four hundred miles; the Island River, by which
a Dutch expedition has recently reached the central
watershed of New Guinea; the Noord River by which
Mr. H. Lorentz approached Mount Wilhelmina; the
Utakwa and the Utanata.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATIVES OF NEW GUINEA</div>

<p>The natives of New Guinea are Papuans and the
island is indeed the centre of that race, which is found
more or less mixed with other races from the island of
Flores as far as Fiji. Though the Papuans in New
Guinea itself have been in many places altered by
immigrant races, for instance by Malays in the extreme
West, and by Polynesian and Melanesian influences in
the South and East, there yet remain large regions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
particularly in the Western half of the country, including
the district visited by this expedition, where the true
Papuan stock holds its own.</p>

<p>The name Papua, it should be said, comes from
the Malay wood <i>papuwah</i>, meaning “woolly” or “fuzzy,”
and was first applied to the natives on account of their
mops of hair; later the name was applied to the island
itself.</p>

<p>Even among those Papuans who are pure-blooded—in
so far as one may use that expression in describing
any human race—there are very considerable varieties
of appearance, but it is still possible to describe a type
to which all of them conform in the more important
particulars. The typical Papuan is rather tall and is
usually well-built. The legs of the low country people
are somewhat meagre, as is usually the case among
people who spend much of their time in canoes, whilst
those of the hill tribes are well developed. The hands
and feet are large. The colour of the skin varies from
a dark chocolate colour to a rusty black, but it seems to
be never of the shining ebony blackness of the African
negro. The lips are thick but not full, the teeth are
strong but not noticeably good, and the jaws are strong
but they can hardly be called prognathous. The
forehead is receding, the brows are strong and prominent,
and the shape of the face is somewhat oval.
The hair is black and “frizzly” rather than “woolly,”
it is crisp and hard to the touch, and in some tribes it
is grown to a considerable length and dressed in a
variety of ornamental fashions. Short hard hair is
also found frequently on the chest and on the limbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
but on the face it is scanty and frequently altogether
absent.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature is the nose, which
is long and fleshy and somewhat “Semitic” in outline,
but flattened and depressed at the tip. But these
characteristics of the nose would not alone suffice to
distinguish the Papuans from others were it not for the
fact that the <i>alae nasi</i> are attached at a remarkably
high level on the face, and so an unusually large extent
of the <i>septum</i> of the nose is exposed. It is owing to
this curious formation of the nose that the Papuan is
enabled to perform his almost universal practice of
piercing the <i>septum nasi</i> and wearing there some ornament
of bone or shell.</p>

<p>Apart from physical characteristics many observers
have found mental qualities in which the Papuans
differ from, and are superior to, neighbouring races;
but these things are so difficult to define, and they vary
so much according to local circumstances, that it is
not wise to use them as conclusive evidence. It may,
however, be said without fear of contradiction that
no person, who has had experience of Malays and of
Papuans, could believe for a moment that they are
anything but two very distinct races of men. The
origin of the Papuans is not definitely known, and the
existence in different parts of the island of small people,
who are possibly of Negrito stock, suggests that the
Papuans were not the original inhabitants of New
Guinea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EARLY SPANISH NAVIGATORS</div>

<p>The history of the earliest discovery of New Guinea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
is not precisely known, but it is safe to disregard the
legends of navigators having found the island before
the Portuguese reached the Moluccas and founded a
trading centre at Ternate in 1512. The earliest authentic
record is of the Portuguese Don Jorge de Meneses, who
was driven out of his way on a voyage from Goa to
Ternate in 1526, and took refuge in the island of Waigiu.
Two years later a Spaniard Alvaro de Saavedra taking
spices from the Moluccas to Mexico appears to have
reached the Schouten Islands in Geelvink Bay. From
there he sailed North and discovered the Carolines and
the Mariana Islands, but unfavourable winds drove
him back to the Moluccas. In 1529 he set out again,
and sailed along a long expanse of coast, which was
doubtless the North coast of New Guinea.</p>

<p>In 1546 Ynigo Ortiz de Retes sailed from Ternate
to Mexico in his ship <i>San Juan</i>. He touched at several
places on the North coast where he hoisted the Spanish
flag, and called the island Nueva Guinea, because the
natives appeared to him to resemble the negroes of
the Guinea coast of Africa. The name, spelt Nova
Guinea, appears printed for the first time on Mercator’s
map of 1569.</p>

<p>The last important Spanish Expedition was that of
Luis Vaz de Torres, who sailed with two ships from
Peru, and in 1606 reached the south-east corner of
New Guinea. He sailed along the South coast from
one to the other end of the island, of which he took
possession in the name of the King of Spain. Torres’
voyage through the strait which now bears his name
was the first to show that New Guinea was an island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
but the account of the voyage was not published and the
fact of his discovery remained unknown until after
1800.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century was chiefly notable for the
explorations of the Dutch, whose East India Company
proclaimed a monopoly of trade in the Spice Islands
to the exclusion of people of other nationalities. In
1605, Willem Jansz sailed from Banda to New Guinea
in the <i>Duyfken</i>. The Ké and Aru Islands were visited
and the Cape York Peninsula of Australia was reached,
but the importance of that discovery was not realised.
On the mainland of New Guinea nine men of the ship’s
company were killed and eaten, and the expedition
returned to Banda.</p>

<p>Jacques Le Maire and Willem Schouten made an
important voyage in 1616 in the <i>Eendracht</i>. Sailing
from Europe by way of Cape Horn they crossed the
Pacific and discovered New Ireland, where they had
trouble with the natives, who (it is interesting to note)
gave them pigs in exchange for glass beads. The
Admiralty and Vulcan Islands were seen and then,
after reaching the coast of New Guinea, they discovered
the mouth of the Kaiserin Augusta River and the
Schouten Islands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VOYAGE OF JAN CARSTENSZ</div>

<p>The next important voyage, and in this chronicle
the most important of all, was that of Jan Carstensz
(or Carstenszoon) who sailed from Amboina in 1623
with the ships <i>Pera</i> and <i>Arnhem</i>. After visiting Ké
and Aru they reached the S.W. coast of New Guinea,
where they met with trouble. “This same day
(February 11) the skipper of the yacht <i>Arnhem</i>, Dirck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Meliszoon, without knowledge of myself or the sub-cargo
or steersman of the said yacht, unadvisedly
went ashore to the open beach in the pinnace, taking
with him fifteen persons, both officers and common
sailors, and no more than four muskets, for the purpose
of fishing with a seine-net. There was great disorder
in landing, the men running off in different directions,
until at last a number of black savages came running
forth from the wood, who first seized and tore to
pieces an assistant named Jan Willemsz Van den
Briel who happened to be unarmed, after which they
slew with arrows, callaways, and with the oars which
they had snatched from the pinnace, no less than
nine of our men, who were unable to defend themselves,
at the same time wounding the remaining
seven (among them the skipper, who was the first to
take to his heels); these last seven men at last returned
on board in very sorry plight with the pinnace and
one oar, the skipper loudly lamenting his great want
of prudence, and entreating pardon for the fault he
had committed.”</p>

<p>The incautious skipper died of his wounds on the
following day and so he did not take a part in the most
momentous discovery of the voyage. “In the morning
of the 16th (February) we took the sun’s altitude
at sunrise, which we found to be 5° 6´; the preceding
evening ditto 20° 30´; the difference being divided
by two comes to 7° 42´; increasing North-easterly
variation; the wind N. by E.; we were at about
one and a half mile’s distance from the low-lying
land in 5 or 6 fathom, clayey bottom; at a distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of about 10 miles by estimation into the interior we
saw a very high mountain range in many places white
with snow, which we thought a very singular sight,
being so near the line equinoctial. Towards the
evening we held our course E. by S., along half-submerged
land in 5, 4, 3, and 2 fathom, at which last
point we dropped anchor; we lay there for about
five hours, during which time we found the water to
have risen 4 or 5 feet; in the first watch, the wind
being N.E., we ran into deeper water and came to
anchor in 10 fathom, where we remained for the
night.”</p>

<p>That is the brief account of the first discovery of the
Snow Mountains of New Guinea by Jan Carstensz, whose
name is now perpetuated in the highest summit of the
range. Very few ships have sailed along that coast in
three hundred years, and there are very many days in
the year when not a sign of the mountains can be seen
from the shore, so it is not very astonishing to find
ships’ captains sailing on those seas who still disbelieve
the story of the snow. On the same voyage Carstensz
crossed the straits and sailed a considerable way down
the Cape York Peninsula believing that the land was
still New Guinea.</p>

<p>In 1636 Thomas Pool explored a large tract of the
S.W. coast; Pool himself was killed by natives, but
the expedition discovered three large rivers, the Kupera
Pukwa, Inabuka (? Neweripa), and the Utakwa. Tasman
sailed along the North coast of New Guinea in 1642
after his discovery of Van Diemen’s Land (Tasmania);
and in 1644 he was sent to find out whether there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
a passage between New Guinea and the large “South
Land” (Australia). Apparently he cruised along the
coast about as far as Merauke, and also touched Australia,
but the strait was not discovered.</p>

<p>Throughout the seventeenth century the Dutch East
India Company maintained their monopoly of the cloves
and nutmegs of the Moluccas, and great consternation
was caused when the English tried to obtain these spices
direct by sending ships to the Papuan islands. The
Moluccas were protected by forts and their harbours
safe, therefore in order to prevent the English from
obtaining the spices outside the sphere of direct Dutch
influence, all trees producing spices were destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DAMPIER AND COOK</div>

<p>The most important of the English voyages was
that of Capt. William Dampier in the <i>Roebuck</i>. He
sailed by Brazil and the Cape of Good Hope to Western
Australia and thence to Timor. On January 1, 1700,
he sighted the mountains of New Guinea; he landed
on several islands near the coast, captured Crowned
pigeons and many kinds of fishes, which he described
in his book. Rounding the N.W. corner of the island
he sailed along the North coast and discovered that
New Britain was separated from New Guinea by a
strait to which he gave his own name.</p>

<p>After the voyages of Philip Carteret, who proved
that New Ireland is an island, and of de Bougainville
in 1766 the most important is that of Captain James
Cook in the <i>Endeavour</i>. He sailed from Plymouth in
August 1768, rounded Cape Horn, reached and charted
New Zealand, reached the East coast of New Holland
(Australia) in April 1770, and sailed along the coast to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Cape York, which he named. Looking Westward he
decided that there was a channel leading from the
Pacific to the Indian Ocean, and after sailing through
it he came to the coast of New Guinea to the N.W. of
Prince Frederick Henry Island, where he was attacked
by natives and thence he sailed to Batavia. Thus
Captain Cook by sailing through his Endeavour Strait,
now called Torres Strait after the original navigator,
repeated the discovery of Torres after an interval of
more than a century and a half, and the general position
and outline of New Guinea became known to the
world.</p>

<p>After the voyage of Cook many important additions
were made to the charts of New Guinea and its neighbouring
islands, notably by the voyages of La Perouse
(1788), John MacCluer (1790-1793), D’Entrecasteaux
(1792-1793), Duperrey (1823-1824), D. H. Kolff (1826),
and Dumont d’Urville (1827-1828).</p>

<p>But during all this time New Guinea was practically
no man’s land, and except at Dorei and about the
MacCluer Gulf explorations were limited to views from
the deck of a ship. Flags were hoisted now and then
and the land taken possession of in the name of various
sovereigns and companies, amongst others by the East
India Company in 1793, but no effective occupation
was ever made. The Dutch regained their title to the
Western half of the island, but it was not until 1884
that a British Protectorate was proclaimed over the
S.E. portion of the island, and over the remainder by
Germany in the same year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECENT EXPLORATION</div>

<p>Although numerous naturalists, notably Dr. A. R.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
Wallace, Von Rosenberg, and Bernstein, and missionaries
had spent considerable periods of time in the country,
no very serious attempt was made to penetrate into the
interior until 1876, when the Italian naturalist, d’Albertis,
explored the Fly River for more than five hundred miles.
Since that time a very large number of expeditions
have been undertaken to various parts of the island,
and it will only be possible to mention a few of them
here. In 1885 Captain Everill ascended the Strickland
tributary of the Fly River. In the same year Dr. H. O.
Forbes explored the Owen Stanley range, and in 1889
Sir William Macgregor reached the highest point of that
range.</p>

<p>In Dutch New Guinea very little exploration was
done until the beginning of the present century. Professor
Wichmann made scientific investigations in the
neighbourhood of Humboldt Bay in 1903. Captains
Posthumus Meyes and De Rochemont in 1904 discovered
East Bay and the Noord River, which was explored
by Mr. H. A. Lorentz in 1907.</p>

<p>During the period from 1909 to 1911, whilst our party
was in New Guinea, there were six other expeditions
in different parts of the Dutch territory. On the N.
coast a Dutch-German boundary commission was penetrating
inland from Humboldt Bay, and a large party
under Capt. Fransse Herderschee was exploring the
Amberno River. On the West and South coasts an
expedition was exploring inland from Fak-fak, another
was surveying the Digoel and Island rivers, and a third
made an attempt to reach the Snow Mountains by
way of the Utakwa River. But the most successful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
all the expeditions was that of Mr. Lorentz, who sailed
up the Noord River and in November 1909 reached
the snow on Mount Wilhelmina, two hundred and eighty-six
years after the mountains were first seen by Jan
Carstensz.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVAL IN NEW GUINEA</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we left the northernmost end of the Aru Islands
behind us the wind rose and torrents of rain descended,
and the Arafura Sea, which is almost everywhere more
or less shoal water, treated us to the first foul weather
we had experienced since leaving England. At dawn
on the 4th January we found ourselves in sight of land,
and about five miles south of the New Guinea coast.
A big bluff mountain (Mount Lakahia) a southern spur
of the Charles Louis range determined our position, and
the head of the <i>Nias</i> was immediately turned to the
East. As we steamed along the coast the light grew
stronger, and we saw in the far North-east pale clouds,
which presently resolved themselves into ghostly-looking
mountains one hundred miles away. Soon the rising
sunlight touched them and we could clearly see white
patches above the darker masses of rock and then we
knew that these were the Snow Mountains of New
Guinea, which we had come so far to see. Beyond an
impression of their remoteness and their extraordinary
steepness we did not learn much of the formation of
the mountains from that great distance and they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
quickly hidden from our view, as we afterwards found
happened daily, by the dense white mists that rose from
the intervening land.</p>

<p>Following the coast rather more closely we soon
found that our approach was causing some excitement
on shore. White columns of the smoke of signal fires
curled up from the low points of the land and canoes
manned by black figures paddled furiously in our wake,
while others, warned doubtless by the signals, put off
from the land ahead of us and endeavoured to intercept
us in our course.</p>

<p>In some of the larger canoes there were as many
as twenty men, and very fine indeed they looked standing
up in the long narrow craft which they urged swiftly
forward with powerful rhythmic strokes of their long-shafted
paddles. At the beginning of each stroke the
blade of the paddle is at right angles to the boat. As
it is pulled backward the propelling surface of the
paddle is a little rotated outward, a useful precaution,
for the stroke ends with a sudden jerk as the paddle
is lifted from the water and the consequent shower of
spray is directed away from the canoe.</p>

<p>The shore was low and featureless, and it was
impossible to identify the mouths of the rivers from
the very inaccurate chart. It was not safe for the
<i>Nias</i> to approach the land closely on account of the
shoal water, so Capt. Van Herwerden dropped anchor
when he had been steaming Eastwards for about eight
hours, and sent the steam launch towards an inlet,
where we could see huts, to gather information. A
bar of sand prevented the launch from entering the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
inlet, so they hailed a canoe which ventured within
speaking distance, and by repeating several times
“Mimika,” the only word of their language that we
knew at that time, learnt that we had overshot our
destination by a few miles. That canoe, it should be
noted, was remarkable on account of two of its crew.
One of them held aloft an ancient Union Jack; the
other was conspicuously different from the scores of
men in the canoes about us, who were all frankly in a
bare undress, by wearing an old white cotton jacket
fastened by a brass button which was ornamented with
the head of Queen Victoria. How the flag and the
coat and the button came to that outlandish place will
never be known, but it is certain that they must have
passed through very many hands before they came there,
for certainly no Englishman had ever been there before.</p>

<p>When the launch returned to the ship a crowd of
natives, fifty or sixty at the least, came clambering on
board leaving only one or two men in each canoe to paddle
after the steamer as we slowly returned towards the
Mimika. Two men were recognised by Capt. Van
Herwerden as having belonged to a party of natives
from this coast, who had been taken some years earlier
to Merauke, the Dutch settlement near the southernmost
point of New Guinea. At Merauke they had
got into mischief and had been put in prison from which
nine of them escaped, and these two men, probably
the only survivors of the party, had contrived to find
their way along four hundred miles of coast, peopled
by hostile tribes, back to their own country.</p>

<p>The behaviour of our new fellow passengers was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
remarkable and different from what one expected,
though it was obvious enough at the first glance that
these were people totally different from the Malayan
races both in appearance and demeanour; yet there
was none of that exuberance of spirits, child-like curiosity
and exhibition of merriment and delight in their novel
surroundings described by Wallace<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> and Guillemard<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
and which I had myself seen on the coast of German
New Guinea. A few of them shook hands, or rather
held hands, with us and talked loudly and volubly,
while the rest stared dumbly at us and then wandered
aimlessly about the ship seeking a chance to steal any
loose piece of metal. They showed no fear nor did
they betray any excitement nor any very keen curiosity
about the marvellous things that they were seeing
for the first time. They were quite unmoved by the
spectacle of the windlass lifting up the anchor, and a
casual glance down the skylight of the engine room
was enough for most of them. They appeared to take
everything for granted without question, and a stolid
stare was their only recognition of the wonderful works
of the white man’s civilisation. In one respect it is
true they were not quite so apathetic and that was in
their appetite for tobacco, which they begged from
everyone on board, brown and white alike. When they
had obtained a supply, they sat in groups about the
deck and smoked as unconcernedly as though a passage
in a steamship were an affair of every-day occurrence
in their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">MOUTH OF THE MIMIKA</div>

<p>By the time that we eventually anchored off the
mouth of the Mimika River it was beginning to grow
dark, and Capt. Van Herwerden ordered the natives
on board to leave the ship, not having noticed that the
canoes had already departed towards the shore. No
doubt this was a preconcerted scheme of the natives
who wanted to stay on board, but by dint of much
shouting two canoes were persuaded to return and take
away some of our passengers. It was then quite dark
and there was a white mist over the sea, and the spectacle
of the procession of black figures passing down the
gangway into an apparent abyss, for the canoes were
invisible in the gloom, was singularly weird. There
was not room for all in the canoes, so about a score of
fortunate ones had to stop on board, where they slept
in picturesque attitudes about the deck. Five young
men chose a place where the iron cover of the steering
chain made a pillow a few inches high; they lay on
their sides all facing the same way, their arms folded
across their chests and their bent knees fitting into the
bend of the knees of the man in front, and so close
together that the five of them occupied a space hardly
more than five feet square.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight on the following day the steam
launch left the ship with a party to proceed up the
Mimika and find a suitable place for a base-camp. The
river has a fine wide mouth about a mile across guarded
by a sand bar, through which runs a narrow channel
navigable at all stages of the tide except during rough
weather. For some distance the river is a noble stream
two or three hundred yards wide winding in fine sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
between low mangrove-covered banks. About three
miles from the sea the river divides into an East and
West branch. The East branch, the Mimika proper,
brings down not more than one-quarter of the volume
of water of the West branch, of which it may be said
to be a tributary. It is remarkable that the party who
visited the Mimika in 1902 apparently overlooked the
fact that the West branch is actually the main river.
Above the junction of the two branches the water of
the Mimika is of a brown chocolate colour which
proclaims it, though we did not know it at the time,
to be a mere jungle stream rising from comparatively
low ground. The water of the West branch on the
contrary is pale in colour and at times of flood almost
milky-white, being charged with lime-stone from the
high mountains where it rises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WELCOME OF TEARS</div>

<p>Proceeding for two or three miles up the Mimika,
which had become above the junction a comparatively
insignificant stream forty or fifty yards across
and very tortuous, the exploring party in the steam
launch arrived at the village of Wakatimi situated
on the right bank of the river. The village was crowded
with natives, numbering perhaps one thousand people,
who gave the visitors a most remarkable reception.
As soon as the boat appeared in sight the natives
crowded down to the bank and shouted shrilly, men,
women and children. When they came nearer the
people threw themselves into the shallow water and
many of them plastered themselves with mud, while
the women performed their curious dance, if dance it
can be called. It is not a concerted performance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
but rather a <i>pas seul</i> executed by each woman independently
of the others, and it is a peculiarly ungraceful
exhibition. The body is bent forward from the
hips, the hands rest on the knees or on the hips, and
then with a shuffling movement of the feet the woman
swings herself from side to side or up and down, always
presenting her back and the narrow strip of barkcloth,
which usually hangs down like a tail behind, to the
astonished gaze of the spectator. She sings all the
while a monotonous whining chant and occasionally
looks back over her shoulder, as if to see that the
onlooker is properly appreciative of her charms. Many
of the people both men and women on this and other
occasions of great excitement were so overcome with
emotion that they actually shed tears of rapture.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
For many days after this boats were constantly coming
up the river from the ship, and they were always
welcomed in a similar manner by the natives.</p>

<p>The river was explored for a few miles further up,
but the only suitable place for a camp was found to
be on the left bank of the river immediately opposite
to Wakatimi. Lieut. Cramer and a party of his
soldiers established themselves there the same afternoon
and the work of clearing the ground and landing
the stores was immediately begun. The <i>Nias</i> was
anchored about two miles outside the river and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>launch went very slowly when it had two or three
heavily laden boats to tow against the strong current
of the river, so the business of landing the expedition
was a very slow one, and as there was at first but very
little space for pitching tents on the camping ground
some of us remained for a few days on board. During
those days that were spent on the ship outside the
Mimika we had opportunities in the early morning
of getting a general idea of the broad features of the
country.</p>

<p>At the top of the white sandy beach was in most
places a narrow belt of <i>Casuarina</i> trees, which are
accustomed to grow on sandy or stony soil. They
resemble pines and their pale stems have a fresh green
foliage, which is a pleasing contrast to the dense
monotonous green of the majority of the trees in the
country. Behind the <i>Casuarina</i> belt dense jungle, for
the first few miles consisting entirely of Mangroves and
beyond that of various trees, extends with hardly any
rise of altitude to the foot of the mountains thirty
miles away. This last observation was one of supreme
importance and it affected the whole prospect and
conduct of the expedition. Those of us who had been
to New Guinea before had been accustomed to seeing
a steep shore rising very quickly to the hills. This
is the usual formation along practically the whole of
the North coast of the island, also along a considerable
extent of the South-east coast and again on the West
coast in the neighbourhood of MacCluer Gulf. It
was known of course that the South coast on both
sides of the mouth of the Fly River and about Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Frederick Henry Island was low swampy country,
but it was assumed that, considering the fact that the
highest peaks of the Snow Mountains were known to
be not more than seventy miles from the sea, the foothills
would certainly extend to within a short distance
of the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIEW OF THE MOUNTAINS</div>

<p>Before we had reached the country we had had
the idea that in a few days’ march we should find ourselves
in the hills at perhaps three or four thousand
feet above the sea, but the view of the country which
we saw from the <i>Nias</i> effectually put an end to any hopes
of that kind. It is probable that more searching
enquiries made at Batavia would have revealed the
existence of this wide belt of low land, but it seldom
occurs to you to question the truth of such an assumption.
However that may be, a serious mistake was
made and we paid for it dearly enough. The mountains
appeared to rise very steeply from the low ground,
and seen from a distance they appeared to be composed
of parallel ridges lying one behind the other, each one
successively higher than the one in front of it. It
was only in certain lights, and more particularly when
the clouds began to form on them, that you could
distinguish deep and narrow valleys running into the
mountains. The nearer ranges rose steeply enough,
but were not too steep to be covered with dense forest
easily discernible from a distance. The furthermost
ridge on the other hand rose in huge precipices of bare
rock, which showed reddish yellow in the morning
sunlight with here and there downward stripes of
black colour, presumably water, and in other places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
streaks of pure white rock. This precipice, of which
more will be said later, grew smaller towards the West
until it ended at the deep valley, which divides the
Snow Mountains from the range of the Charles Louis
Mountains.</p>

<p>In the opposite direction towards the East the range
rises gradually, until at a point about North-east from
the Mimika three snow-capped tops are seen. I use
the word “top” advisedly, for these three points are not
peaks but are elevations on an otherwise fairly even
mountain outline. The vertical extent of the snow
is not very great, a few hundred feet at the most, the
South face of the mountain being so steep that snow
cannot lie on it save on the horizontal terraces of the
strata, which could plainly be distinguished. Continuing
the ridge East from the three snow tops (Mount
Idenburg) is a long plain of almost level snow about
three miles long. From the East end of the snow
plain a ridge of shattered rock, looking like Dolomite
towers from that great distance, forms a connection
with Mount Carstensz, the highest point of the range.</p>

<p>Seen from afar, Mount Carstensz appears to be of
a different formation from the rest of the range. Mr.
Dumas of the Dutch Expedition to the Utakwa River
clearly identified masses of slate on the Southern face
from a distance of twenty miles, and this would quite
account for its different appearance. There are two
principal tops, a Western black and irregular rock with
scattered patches of snow, and an Eastern top more
even in its outline and entirely covered with snow.
Between the two a glacier of moderate size flows down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
the South face of the mountain. Still further East
from Mount Carstensz could be seen yet other ridges,
apparently a continuation of the Carstensz ridge.
Occasionally these were covered with snow in the early
morning, but no other points of permanent snow could
be seen from the Mimika, and indeed there is no other
until Mount Wilhelmina is reached more than one
hundred miles to the East. But studying the mountains
with field glasses was an occupation which could only
be pursued for a short time, for the clouds formed
early on the ridges and by nine o’clock at the latest
all the higher mountains were hidden from view.</p>

<p>During the first two days that we lay off the Mimika
we were visited by numbers of natives in canoes, who
came some to trade and some merely to stare at the
ship and the people on board. The articles that they
brought for sale consisted chiefly of fish, coconuts and
bananas of a very poor kind, though we afterwards
came to regard these latter as a delicious luxury. They
also brought a few young pigs, young cassowaries, and
other birds and they received payment in beads, scraps
of cloth, empty bottles and tins and pieces of metal.
It is worth while to record, as showing the indolence
of these people, that on the third day no natives came
to visit us. Those who had before come to look at
us had presumably satisfied their curiosity, while the
others who had come to barter were content with the
treasures they had won, although they might have
added greatly to their wealth if they had had the energy
to catch a few fish or pick a few more coconuts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FISHING FOR SHARKS</div>

<p>Another occupation, which served to pass the time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
was fishing for the sharks with which that shallow
sea abounds. They are blunt-nosed animals with large
dusky patches on the skin. It is very seldom that you
see them at the surface of the water, and they appear
to feed always at the bottom. The first that was
caught was found to be full of fragments of large crabs.
Nobody on board was found willing to eat the flesh,
though it is probable that a few months afterwards
they would have been less fastidious, so the fish was
thrown overboard, and an hour or two later a second
shark, a monster about twelve feet long, was hauled,
on board, and on being opened it was found to be full
of large undigested lumps of (presumably) the first.</p>

<p>On January 8th those of us who had remained on
the <i>Nias</i> left the ship and proceeded to Wakatimi,
where we found that Lieut. Cramer and his men had
already done an immense amount of work in clearing
the ground for the camp. It appeared that the place
chosen had been cleared of forest at some time, for
there were no large trees growing on it, but it was
covered with a dense jungle of shrubs and small trees,
a foot or so in thickness and a tangle of creepers.
Already in four days a strip along the river bank about
eighty yards long and thirty yards wide had been
cleared of bush, and as time went on the clearing was
gradually extended until there were twenty acres or
more of open ground about the camp.</p>

<p>During the first two or three days the natives, who
had assembled in large numbers at the village of Wakatimi,
helped a good deal in clearing the ground and
landing the stores. When the steam launch towing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the laden boats arrived at the camp they fell upon
the boats in hordes and quickly carried everything
up the steep mud bank, but this amusement palled
upon them very soon, and they stood about doing nothing
and hampered the men at their work of unpacking.
Accordingly a stout wooden fence was built about the
landward side of the camp and over this they were
content to gaze from morning till night. They stood
packed together five or six deep, and the press of those
at the back trying to catch a glimpse of what was
going on was so great that two or three times the
fence fell bodily inwards, and with it a struggling mass
of black humanity; but it was not many days before
their curiosity was satisfied, and though they did not
afford us very much assistance it was fortunate that
they were not inclined to molest or interfere with us
in any way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR FIRST LOSS</div>

<p>We had only been in our camp at Wakatimi for
one day and it already seemed as if the place was
beginning to show some sign of order, when a melancholy
tragedy threw a gloom over the spirits of the
whole expedition. On the afternoon of January 9th
Mr. Wilfred Stalker, who had had plenty of experience
of tropical and Australian jungles, went out from the
camp taking his collecting gun to shoot some birds.
The usual daily rain began at about four o’clock, but
as we were all busy with various occupations in our
tents his absence was not noticed until after six o’clock,
when it was already pitch dark and the rain was falling
in torrents. Beyond the camp was dense jungle intersected
by creeks and pools of water, difficult enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
to traverse by day but absolutely impassable in darkness,
so there was nothing to be done that night but
to hope anxiously that Stalker’s bushcraft had prompted
him to make a shelter of some kind, if disaster had
not already overtaken him. At dawn Lieut. Cramer
sent out parties of soldiers in all directions, and soon
all of us, Europeans, Gurkhas, and native soldiers were
out searching and shouting and firing shots. With
some difficulty we explained to the natives what had
happened, and we offered them large rewards if they
were successful in finding him, and many of them
joined with us; but though the ground was carefully
quartered and the search was continued all that day
and a part of the next not a trace of him was found
anywhere, and it was evidently hopeless that he could
ever be found alive. On the second day, when the search
had been abandoned, the natives were convinced of his
fate, and two of the more important people came over from
the village and wailed loudly outside his empty tent.</p>

<p>On January 12th all doubts as to his end were set
at rest when a canoe manned by four Papuans, smeared
with mud as their custom is in such circumstances,
brought back his body from a creek about half a mile
from the camp, where it had been found. Up to that
moment there had been present in our minds the
horrid suspicion that he might perhaps have fallen
the victim to foul play. We thought that natives finding
him wandering alone might have been tempted
by his possessions and have murdered him, but it was
evidently not so and we could only hope that by drowning
death had come swiftly to him.</p>

<p>We buried him under a tree about one hundred yards
behind the camp, and in the absence of the leader of
the expedition, who had gone away with Rawling and
Cramer to reconnoitre the river above Wakatimi, I
read the short burial service. Besides Marshall and
Shortridge and myself there were a Dutch soldier, two
convicts and about fifty Papuans, who stood quietly
in a wide circle about the grave. I think the ninetieth
psalm was never read to a more remarkable congregation.
The grave was the first of the graves of many
who left their bones in New Guinea.</p>

<p>Wilfred Stalker was in his thirty-first year when
he died. Previously he had spent many years as a
naturalist in Australia and several months in New
Guinea. Early in 1909 he returned to the East where
he spent a part of his time in engaging coolies for the
New Guinea Expedition, and he had time to make
an interesting journey in the Island of Ceram, where
he made a remarkable zoological collection. He joined
us at Amboina on January 1st so that we had not time
to know him well, but his unflagging energy in the
preparations at the base-camp, where he landed with
the first party, showed that he was a man whom the
expedition could ill afford to lose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all the stores and equipment of the expedition
had been landed at Wakatimi, an operation which
took six days and some ten or more journeys of the
steam launch towing many boats to accomplish, the
<i>Nias</i> returned to Dobo, and brought back from there
on the 14th January our Ambonese coolies, who had
arrived there by mail steamer from Amboina. To
those of us who had had experience of native carriers
in other countries, the appearance of the ninety-six
Ambonese came as something of a shock. When the
boats crowded with them came within sight of the camp
the natives cried out that our women were coming, and
they might well be excused for their mistake. With
their wide straw hats and coloured coats and shirts and
gay <i>sarongs</i> they had not much the appearance of men,
and we wondered what sort of people they would be
to force a way through the trackless country. When
they landed, our first impression of their unsuitableness
was rather strengthened than otherwise. Every man
(to give them a dignity which very few of them deserved)
had a large wooden or tin box as well as a huge bundle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>of bedding and mats. Their average age appeared to
be about sixteen years, and though they were said to
be the best men obtainable in Amboina, the physique
of most of them was wretched. It was evidently useless
to keep so many feeble creatures, so it was decided
to keep fifty of the more promising and send the rest
back to Amboina by the <i>Nias</i>, which was waiting at
the mouth of the Mimika until the following day. The
whole gang was paraded and a more hopeless looking
lot it would be hard to imagine. With great difficulty
we picked out fifty who, though they had little appearance
of strength, were not obviously crippled by disease,
and the forty-six others were sent away without having
done a single day’s work.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">AMBONESE COOLIES</div>

<p>The question of coolies, as we were to find by bitter
experience during the ensuing months, is the point
that determines the success or failure of an expedition.
Mr. Stalker had left England charged with the duty
of engaging coolies for this expedition. It was hoped
that he would be able to get a number of men in the
Ké Islands, but failing to engage them there he had
seen in Amboina his only chance of recruiting a sufficient
number of men. No blame can be attached to
him, for he had had no experience of the kind before
and his instructions were not very detailed, but it was
a mistake which seriously delayed the progress of the
expedition.</p>

<p>As well as the trouble involved in trying to make
a silk purse of efficient coolies out of the sow’s ear of
the Amboina rabble we were confronted by another
difficulty of transport. It has been mentioned above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
(page 43) that before we arrived in the country it
was expected that we should find rising ground close
to the sea, and that in a few days’ journey at the most
we should reach an altitude of three thousand feet or
upwards, but the discovery that there was a tract of
level country hardly above sea level extending from
the coast to the foot of the mountains thirty miles
inland entirely upset our calculations. Had we known
this before we should necessarily have brought a launch
and boats to tow our stores up the many miles of
navigable river, and by so doing we should have saved
ourselves many weeks of valuable time and an infinity
of labour. It is worth while to record this fact, not
for the object of drawing attention to any deficiencies
in the organisation of the expedition, but to demonstrate
the uselessness of entering an unknown country without
having made a preliminary reconnaissance.</p>

<p>An urgent message was despatched to the Navy
Department in Java begging them to supply us with
a steam launch at the earliest opportunity, but communications
are slow in that part of the world, and it
was not until ten weeks afterwards that the launch
arrived at the Mimika. Its career was brief and inglorious.
It made two or three journeys at snail’s
pace up the river before it finally broke down altogether
and was sent back to Java.</p>

<p>In June we purchased from the pearlfishers at Dobo
a petrol motor-boat, which made several successful
trips up the river towing large quantities of stores, and
then it was badly damaged by coming into violent
contact with a sunken tree, and it was several months<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
before it could be repaired sufficiently to float. Thus
it happened that nearly all the river transport of the
expedition was laboriously carried out in canoes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATIVE CANOE</div>

<p>The canoes used by the natives on the Mimika and
neighbouring rivers are simple “dug-outs,” that is they
are made from one tree trunk without any joinery at
all. They vary considerably in size but the length
of an average canoe is about thirty-five feet. The
sides curve inward towards the gunwale so that in
section the canoe forms a large segment of a circle.
The breadth at the gunwale is about eighteen inches
and the breadth at the widest part from eighteen to
twenty-four inches. The gunwales are almost horizontal,
though in some boats there is a considerable
“sheer” towards the end of the canoe. They end in
a square bow and at the stern they come together to
a fine point. The bottom of a canoe—there is no keel—slopes
finely up from the middle towards the ends
so that when the canoe is afloat several feet of its length
at bow and stern are out of water.</p>

<p>The square bow of the canoe is carved in a more
or less symmetrical fashion and there is usually a narrow
margin of ornamental carving at intervals along the
sides. A common feature of this carving, as also of
the other native ornaments, is an object which is intended
to represent the human eye. Occasionally
they attach to the bow of the canoe, one on either
side and one in the middle, three long boards carved
in a sort of fretwork manner and painted red and white.
These project about four feet in front of the bow and
give it somewhat the appearance of a bird’s beak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
The inside of the canoe is sometimes whitened with
lime or sago powder but is otherwise not ornamented.
A few feet from the stern, where the bottom begins
to slope upwards, a low partition of wood is left forming
as it were a sort of bulkhead; the space behind
this is filled with sand on which a fire is kept burning.</p>

<p>Before we came to the country the whole business
of canoe-making from the first felling of the tree to
the final hollowing out of the inside was done with
stone axes and the carving was done with sharpened
shells, a labour which it is difficult to realise, so it is
not surprising that the natives take very great care
of their boats. They never allow water to stand in
them for long, and at the end of a storm of rain the
first thing they do is to go to the river and bail the
water out of their canoes, which they do by scooping
it out with the blade of a paddle. They also take good
care of the outside and frequently char them with fire
to kill the worms, which otherwise quickly destroy
wood in brackish water.</p>

<p>The tree most commonly used for making canoes
is <i>Octomeles moluccana</i>, which has a smooth pale trunk
devoid of branches for a long way above the ground.
When they can do so they choose a tree growing close
to the river bank, but this is not always possible and
we found a place where a tree for a canoe had been
felled fully three hundred yards from the water. The
trunk is roughly shaped where it lies and is then hauled
with immense toil over logs laid on a rough track to the
river; thence it is towed to the village where the
hollowing and shaping is done at leisure. We saw a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>large number of canoes made at Parimau, and in nearly
every case the balance was perfect when they were
first put into the water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p054.jpg" width="500" height="305" alt="CANOES, FINISHED AND UNFINISHED." />
<p class="caption">CANOES, FINISHED AND UNFINISHED.</p>
</div>

<p>The canoes are usually propelled by paddles with
long thin shafts and wide blades which are often beautifully
carved, but in shallow places or rapid water
the natives generally employ a long pole in the use of
which they are very expert. It is easy enough to
stand up and paddle or pole in large canoes, but the
smaller craft are very top-heavy, and the natives perform
wonderful feats of balancing in navigating them.
Their education begins early for we saw in one of the
villages small canoes three or four feet long, in which
the children begin to learn the craft of the waterman
almost before they have learned to walk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PURCHASING CANOES</div>

<p>Though the people value their canoes very highly
they were anxious enough to part with them in exchange
for our knives and pieces of metal, of which they had
none at all, and we very soon had a small fleet of canoes.
The first two were bought for a knife apiece, but the price
soon rose to an axe for a canoe, and in the course of
several months it had still further risen to two axes
or even two axes and a knife.</p>

<p>Within a few days of the arrival of our coolies we
had purchased half a dozen canoes and preparations
were made to send an exploring party up the river.
At that time we were none of us skilful canoe-men and
it was considered safer to use the canoes as rafts by
lashing two side by side and securing a platform of
bamboos across the top. This was a most cumbrous
arrangement which added enormously to the labour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of paddling, and after the first journey it was never
repeated.</p>

<p>On the 18th January, Goodfellow, Rawling, and
Shortridge with twenty-four coolies, six Gurkhas, and
a small party of Javanese soldiers in the charge of a
Dutch sergeant started up the river. They took with
them about a dozen natives, hoping that they would
work hard at paddling and would be useful in other
ways, but they were a perpetual nuisance calling out
for their wives and wanting to stop to eat or sleep; they
finished by stealing one of the canoes and deserting
the night before they would have been sent back to
their homes. With them went another of our cherished
illusions that we should be able to get a great deal of
assistance from the natives of the country. The party
proceeded up the river at an incredibly slow rate on
account of the clumsy rafts, and for four days saw no
signs of inhabitants. On the fifth day they found one
isolated hut, and two days later after passing a few
scattered huts they arrived at the village of Parimau,
above which place the river appeared to be hardly
navigable.</p>

<p>The welcome accorded to the party by the natives
of Parimau was as enthusiastic as that at Wakatimi
described above, the people showing their delight by
smearing themselves with mud and shedding copious
tears. During the following days, when a camp was
being made, hundreds of natives flocked into the place
to see the strange white men, who were exhibited to
the new-comers with a sort of proprietary air by the
natives of Parimau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">TIDES OF THE RIVER</div>

<p>In the meantime a great deal of work was necessary
to put in order the base-camp at Wakatimi, and to
render it secure against an attack, should the natives
ever alter their friendly attitude towards us. The
bush was completely cleared for some distance and
a stout fence built about the camp. Then it was found
that at high tide, and especially at spring tide, a large
part of the camp was flooded and this necessitated a
great amount of levelling and trenching and banking,
a task which appealed to the fenland instinct of Cramer.
The tide made itself felt in the river for several miles
above Wakatimi, where there was a rise and fall of
about ten feet, but the exact tidal movements were
very difficult to recognise. On some days two tides
were distinctly seen, while on many others there
appeared to be only one. Their movements were further
complicated by the very variable amount of water
brought down by the river. Sometimes the river was
almost stagnant, but at other times it swept down
bank-high with a strong current for days at a time,
and no flow of the tide could be noticed. The river
Watuka, which joins the Mimika a few miles below
Wakatimi, had a much greater volume of water than
the latter river, and often when the tide was rising its
waters were easily recognisable by their white colour
floating up past the camp and holding back the waters
of the Mimika in the same way that the Blue Nile,
when it is in flood, forms a pond of the White Nile.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that no suitable place for the
base-camp could be found above the tidal water, because
it increased the difficulty of supplying the camp with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
drinking water, and at times when there was not much
fresh water coming down the river the ebb and flow
of the tide washed the refuse backwards and forwards
in front of the camp. Water was boiled and filtered
every day in quantities large enough for every man
in the camp to have as much as he wished, but the
value of this precaution was to a large extent neutralised
by the Malay habit of washing out the mouth with the
water in which the man bathes.</p>

<p>A wooden landing stage for canoes was built out
over the muddy bank, and a bathing place was cut off
from the river by a wooden fence to protect bathers
from crocodiles and sharks, both of which were occasionally
seen, but as the natives bathed constantly
without showing any fear of either animal the precaution
was perhaps needless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLIES AND CRICKETS</div>

<p>At that time when the ground was being cleared
we began to be plagued by large blue-bottle flies, which
swarmed about the camp and laid their eggs everywhere.
One of their favourite laying grounds was
in our bedding, which in a hot damp climate must
always be hung out to air when the sun shines. You
would find two folds of your blanket stuck together
with horrible masses of eggs and if, as sometimes happened,
you did not scrape them all away you would
wake up at night and find yourself crawling with
maggots. There are some people who are afraid of
spiders, but the most timorous of mortals must find
the homely spider preferable to the loathsome blow
fly. The house where we mostly lived at Wakatimi
and where we had our meals was immediately filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
with blue-bottles the moment our food was brought
in, so we encouraged the larger sort of spider to live
there and one old fellow who lived under the corner
of the table used to come out at meal times and take
his toll of flies, and in the course of time he became so
tame that he would take a living fly out of your fingers.</p>

<p>At the same time, and indeed during the whole
of our stay in the country, we were greatly annoyed
by the depredations of very large crickets. Not content
with making a most distracting noise by night these
horrible creatures did endless damage to our eatable
possessions. They invaded the sacks in which we kept
our scanty garments, socks, vests and the like, and
riddled them into holes, and they appeared to have a
special partiality for sponges and brushes, which they
devoured completely. Even more serious were their
attacks on folded tents or sacks of rice and flour, which
had to be constantly taken out of the store houses and
repaired. When these things were taken out of the
house a large number of crickets were taken out too,
and then was the chance for the Kingfishers (<i>Halcyon
sanctus</i>) which darted down and snapped them up. A
pair of these beautiful little birds haunted the camp
and became so tame that they would fly down from
the roof of a house and pick up a cricket within a foot
or two of a man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDING MATERIAL</div>

<p>When the ground had been well cleared and levelled,
we set about the business of building barracks for the
men and store houses for the provisions and equipment.
The Dutch contingent had brought with them regulation
army barrack frames, pieces of seasoned wood of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
definite lengths which are fitted together by bolts and
screws, and form the skeleton of excellent houses. We
had nothing of the kind, but the jungle supplied plenty
of wood and our houses, though less regular than those
of the Dutch, were very soon built. It is easy enough
to put up the framework of a house in a place where
there is plenty of timber, but the walls and the roof
are a more difficult matter. Fortunately the natives
were adepts in the art of making “atap,” which they
use for roofing their own huts, and they were soon
eagerly making it for us in exchange for our trade
goods.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p060.jpg" width="400" height="562" alt="MAKING 'ATAP' FOR ROOFING." />
<p class="caption">MAKING “ATAP” FOR ROOFING.</p></div>

<p>The best “atap” is made from the leaves of the
Nipa palm (<i>Nipa fruticans</i>) which grows abundantly
in the swampy country. Almost equally good “atap”
can be made from the Sago palm, but the leaves of
the Coconut palm shrivel quickly and are of no use for
the purpose. The method of the manufacture of
“atap” is briefly as follows: Leaflets of the palm are
stripped from the stem, which is then split into three
or four sticks of about an inch and a half in diameter
and five or six feet in length. The man begins by
taking up a leaf and folding it in the middle, thus breaking
the mid-rib of the leaf. He then frees the mid-rib
from the surrounding leaf for a short distance and
breaks off a piece about three inches long for use presently.
Then holding the stick near the end he pushes
the free end of the mid-rib, which is separated from
the leaf, into the soft substance of the stick and folds
the leaf once round the stick in such a way that its
two free ends lie one upon the other. He then clips
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>together the free ends with the short piece he had
broken from the mid-rib. He then repeats the process
with another leaf, making each one slightly overlap
the last, until the stick is completely covered with
folded leaves. It should be said that each leaf is about
three inches wide and four feet long so that the free
ends, when the leaf is folded, lie about two feet from
the stick. “Atap” is always made by the men, never
by the women, and a quick worker will make a complete
piece in about ten minutes.</p>

<p>The method of roofing with “atap” is very simple.
Pieces are fixed by strands of rattan to the timbers
of the roofing beginning from below and overlapping
each other like tiles. The stick end of the “atap” is
uppermost and the free ends point downwards. When
there is no lack of “atap” and the pieces can be laid
on the roof very closely together it forms a most efficient
thatch, which keeps the house tolerably cool in the
hot weather and is impervious to the heaviest downfall
of rain.</p>

<p>The demand for “atap” started our regular trade
with the natives, it brought us into friendly relations
with them and they soon discovered that they could
put confidence in us. When they found that we really
paid them, as we promised, in beads and cloth, there
was keen competition in the “atap” trade and they
brought us as much as we wanted. For a few pieces
only they received beads, while for ten pieces and
upwards we paid them in cloth and they adopted various
tricks to obtain cloth, when they knew that the amount
they brought was only worth beads. One of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
dodges was to bring old pieces of “atap” from their
own houses to increase the size of the pile, and sometimes
a man would steal two or three pieces from the pile
of another man who had already been paid, but they
were always found out and were not in the least ashamed
of themselves. It was important to keep the price
low, because we very well knew that when the people
had obtained as much cloth and as many beads as they
wanted they would never do any more work, and that
did occur after a few months. They greatly enjoyed
a little foolery. For instance, when you were paying
them in cloth it was much more appreciated if you
wound it artistically about the recipient’s head than
if you merely thrust it into his hands; and in paying
a man in beads it was thought a great joke if you let
them slowly trickle into his palm out of your closed
fist. His smile would grow with the pile of beads in
his hand, and he always hoped to find some more
concealed between your fingers.</p>

<p>In addition to “atap” they also brought other
things for trade, sometimes fish from the sea which
were generally uneatable, and sometimes delicious prawns
six or eight inches long from the river estuary. There
was a constant trade in coconuts which grew in some
numbers about Wakatimi, and occasionally we bought
a bunch of bananas. Living birds of many kinds,
cassowaries, pigeons, kingfishers, lories and parrots were
often brought for sale, but the poor creatures were
generally taken straight from the nest, and the soldiers
and coolies who bought them quickly stuffed them
to death with rice. Some of the lories throve and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
became tame enough to fly about at liberty, and the
cassowaries became quite a pest in the camp.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRADING WITH THE NATIVES</div>

<p>So keen did the people become on trading that they
would barter all their worldly possessions for European
goods. Stone clubs and axes, bows and arrows, spears
and drums, the skulls of their forebears, indeed all
their moveable goods were brought to us for exchange.
It may sound rather a mean transaction to buy from
a Papuan a stone axe, which has probably been in
his family for generations, for a small knife or coloured
handkerchief, but he was always delighted with the
exchange and when both parties to it are satisfied a
bargain may be considered a just one.</p>

<p>Our trade goods consisted mostly of coloured beads,
red cloth, knives of various sizes, and axes. Of these
the red cloth was by far the most useful and the most
sought after. The Dutch had cloth of various shades
and patterns, but the natives, with a true eye for colour,
knew that our red stuff suited their dark skins better
than any shade of green or blue. The axes were given
in exchange for canoes, and knives were mostly used
to pay the men who carried for us in the interior.
Fish hooks were greatly appreciated by the natives of
the coast villages, but the Jews’ harps of which we had
a large quantity, though they are greatly in demand
among the Papuans of British New Guinea and in some
of the Pacific Islands, were of no use to us for trade,
and the few we gave away were used either as ornaments
round the neck or as ear-rings. There was
always a great demand for cast-off clothing, but a Papuan
wearing a pair of tattered trousers or a fragment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
a shirt was so unpleasant to look at and he generally
became so demoralised in character, that we made it
a rule not to give them any of our rags. Empty bottles
were of course greatly sought after and the many
thousands of tins which we emptied during the course
of the expedition were wealth untold to a people, who
up to that time had possessed no sort of vessel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the principal obstacles in the way of successful
exploration in Dutch New Guinea is the lack of food
in the country itself. It is true that in the low-lying
swampy districts near the coast there are plenty of
Sago-palms, but the majority of Malays are not sago
eaters except under compulsion, and the preparation
of sago to make it only tolerably palatable is a tedious
business. Moreover the first object of an expedition
to the mountains is to leave the swamps behind as
soon as possible. So it follows that every scrap of
food, for the coolies as well as for the Europeans, has
to be brought into the country from outside, and it
will be evident that, when the means of transport are
distressingly slow, the provisions must diminish considerably
in quantity as they are carried towards the
interior.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPPLIES</div>

<p>The mainstay of the food of Malay coolies and
soldiers is rice, of which the daily ration is one <i>katti</i>
(1-1/3 pounds); to this is added about a quarter of a
pound of dried meat or dried fish. Once or twice a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
week the rice was replaced by <i>kachang ijau</i>, a small
round green bean, which is supposed to be of use in
preventing the onset of beri-beri, though it is very
doubtful whether this is the case; the beans are
boiled and are eaten either with salt or with brown
Javanese sugar. A full ration for a coolie also includes
tea, coffee, salt and chillies. When it is remembered
that the numbers of the expedition were never less than
one hundred and twenty and were often more than
one hundred and sixty, and since it was considered
advisable always to have a supply for several
months in advance in the eventuality of communication
with Amboina becoming impossible, it can be
imagined that the amount of stores necessary for the
whole party was no small thing. The management
of the stores of Cramer’s party alone, of which
every detail had to be accounted for to the Government,
occupied the full time of a Dutch sergeant and a
native clerk.</p>

<p>Not only was a great deal of labour involved in
dealing with such an immense bulk of stores, but there
was considerable difficulty in preserving them from
the ill effects of the climate. Our first consignment of
rice arrived in sacks, and the futility of that method
of packing was apparent, when a great quantity of it
was spoilt by a shower of rain between the steamer and
the base-camp. The next lot was packed in tins with
lids; when these were turned upside down the rice
trickled out or water trickled in, and again a large
quantity was lost or spoilt. After that it was put into
tins of which the tops were soldered down, but even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
that was not quite successful, for it often happened
that a pin-hole was left unsoldered, through which
moisture would eventually find its way and the rice
be spoilt.</p>

<p>Even more difficult than the rice to keep dry were
the dried fish and dried meat, which were sent to us
packed in wooden boxes; the stuff quickly became
sodden from the moisture-laden atmosphere, and although
we kept coolies constantly employed in drying it in
the sun, an enormous amount of it became rotten and
was thrown away. The only effectual method of preserving
the dried meat and fish is to seal it up like
the rice in soldered tins. The tin always used for this
purpose is the rectangular tin in which kerosene oil
is imported to the East; filled with rice it weighs about
forty pounds.</p>

<p>In writing the history of this expedition I should
not be honest if I were to refrain from mentioning the
fact that some of our own stores were, to say the least,
ill-chosen. It appeared that a large quantity of stores
had been bought from the Shackleton Expedition,
which had returned from the Antarctic a few months
before we left England. However suitable those provisions
may have been for a Polar expedition, they were
not the sort of thing one would have chosen for a
journey in the Tropics. For instance, large tins of
“bully-beef” are excellent in a cold climate, but when
you open them near the Equator you find that they
consist of pallid lumps of pink flesh swimming in a
nasty gravy. Pea-soup and pea-flour, of which we
had nearly four hundred pounds’ weight, strike terror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
into the stoutest heart, when the temperature is 86°
in the shade. Pickles are all very well in their way
for those that like them, but one hundred and sixty
bottles was more than a generous allowance. <i>Punch</i>,
in commenting on a newspaper misprint which stated
that “the British Ornithologists Union Expedition
to Papua was joined at Singapore by ten pickled
Gurkhas,” suggested that it was “no doubt a misprint
for gherkins.” We were glad that Mr. Punch
was mistaken and that we had not increased our store
of pickles at Singapore.</p>

<p>The packing was almost as remarkable as the choice
of the stores themselves: they were secured in strong
packing cases of large and variable size fastened with
bands of iron and an incredible number of nails, suitable
enough to withstand the banging of Polar storms,
but not well adapted to their present purpose. The
boxes were all too big for convenient transport, and
as each one was filled with food of one kind only every
box had to be opened at once and a selection made
from them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SUPPLIES</div>

<p>Here it must be said that, in response to our comments
on the stores and the packing, the Committee
sent out to us an excellent supply of provisions from
Messrs. Fortnum and Mason, properly packed in light
“Vanesta” cases. These reached us at the end of
August and during the rest of our stay in the country
we fared well.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p068.jpg" width="400" height="457" alt="JANGBIR AND HERKAJIT, GURKHAS." />
<p class="caption">JANGBIR AND HERKAJIT, GURKHAS.</p></div>

<p>We took with us a small supply of whisky and brandy,
which was often acceptable, and I believe that in an
excessively damp climate a small quantity of alcohol
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>may be beneficial. The Dutch took with them dry
Hollands gin, which is drunk with a small quantity of
bitters before dinner; it certainly has the effect of
coaxing your appetite for tinned foods, all of which,
when you have lived on them for a few months, have
the same dull taste.</p>

<p>It may be thought that the above discourse on the
subject of food is unduly long, but I shall make no
apology for it, because equally with the question of
transport the question of food is of paramount importance.
The recital of some of the mistakes that
we made may serve as a warning to others, who wish
to visit a similar district. In countries like Africa
and many parts of Asia, where the people cultivate the
soil and where there are numbers of game animals,
you may always look forward to varying your fare
with some fresh food, either animal or vegetable; but
when you go to New Guinea you must be prepared to
live wholly on dried and tinned foods, and that is
only possible when they are varied and of the best
manufacture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MIMIKA RIVER</div>

<p>During the first months of our stay in New Guinea
most of the energies of the expedition were spent in
transporting supplies from the base-camp at Wakatimi
to the camp at Parimau up the Mimika River. And
indeed it may be said that this was one of the principal
occupations of the expedition from beginning to end;
for our coolies were very soon worn out by sickness
and the unaccustomed labour, so that they had to be
sent back to their homes, and by the time that a fresh
batch of coolies arrived in the country the store of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
provisions at Parimau was exhausted and the process
of taking up a fresh supply had to be begun again.</p>

<p>It was not until our third batch of coolies came
at the end of December, that we were able to accumulate
enough stores at Parimau to serve as a base for
a moderately long expedition from that place. Before
that time it had never been possible to make a longer
march than three days from Parimau, and there had
been long periods when from lack of coolies everything
had been at a standstill. Those times were of course
excessively trying both to the health and to the tempers
of the members of the expedition. It was irksome
beyond words to see day after day the mountains in
the distance and to be unable to move a step nearer
to them.</p>

<p class="caption">HAULING CANOES UP THE MIMIKA.</p></div>

<p>The distance from Wakatimi to Parimau, though
only twenty-two miles as the crow flies, was about
forty miles by water, and it took from five to seven
days, according to the state of the river, to accomplish
the journey in canoes. While the coolies were still
comparatively fresh, we sometimes sent off as many
as six canoes at a time from Wakatimi to Parimau,
but with sickness and fatigue their numbers quickly
diminished and two or three canoes laden with stores,
accompanied by one “escort” canoe manned by
Javanese soldiers and convicts, was the size of the
usual river “transport.” The larger canoes were paddled
by five or six and the smaller by four men; the average
load carried by one canoe was about eight hundred
pounds’ weight, of which a considerable amount was
consumed on the journey. The men were given one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>day’s rest at Parimau, they came down the river in
two days and rested for two days at Wakatimi before
starting up the river again. One of us accompanied
them on nearly every journey with a view to preventing
the men from lingering too many days on the voyage
and partly as a protection from the natives, who paid
great respect to us but were inclined to behave rudely to
the coolies, if they were not accompanied by an European.</p>

<p>Those days of canoeing up the Mimika River were
some of the most monotonous of my life and I shall
never forget them. For the first few miles above
Wakatimi the river is about as wide as the Thames
at Windsor, the banks are covered with smallish trees
with here and there clumps of palm trees, from which
fresh young coconuts may be gathered. Occasionally
the rising tide helps you on your way, and if you are
particularly fortunate you may even see at the end
of a straight reach of the river a glimpse of the distant
mountains. But very soon the river narrows to half
its width, the huge trees of the regular New Guinea
jungle shut out all except a narrow strip of sky, and
the river twists and meanders towards all the points
of the compass, until you wonder whether it will not
eventually bring you back to the point whence you
started. There was one bend of the river which was
particularly remarkable; it made an almost complete
circle of about a mile and a half in circumference, ending
at a point exactly forty yards distant from its commencement,
so that by landing and walking across a
narrow neck you could wait for more than half an hour
for the canoes to overtake you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>The rate of travel varied with the efficiency of the
coolies and according to the strength of the current
in the river, which was sometimes very sluggish, and
at other times came swirling down at three or four
miles an hour. We cleared camping places at various
points along the river, and, if the pace was good, the
average stage was about six hours, though it often
took ten or even twelve hours when the river was in
flood. The pleasantest camping places were on mudbanks,
where the coolies could bathe and pitch their
tents without trouble, but they were very liable to be
flooded by a sudden rise of the river during the night,
and we generally had our own tents pitched on a space
cleared in the jungle at the top of a steep bank.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CANOEING UP THE MIMIKA</div>

<p>It will be convenient to describe a day’s voyage
up the Mimika by taking an extract from my diary:—</p>

<p class="p padl2">“May 13. The monotony of the river is beyond
words, and one day is almost exactly like another.
I get up at six o’clock and breakfast off cocoa
and biscuits and butter, whilst the camp is coming
down, <i>i.e.</i> tents, etc., being packed. Spend the
next hour or rather more in hurrying on the
coolies with their food, which they ought always
to begin to cook half an hour earlier than they
do. See everything put into the canoes and
then start with the last. After that anything
from five to twelve hours’ sitting on a damp tent
with one’s feet in more or less (according to the
weather) water swishing from side to side of
the canoe. Sometimes I paddle, but not so much
now as I did the first time I came up the river,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>not from laziness but because the irregular time
is so horribly irritating. If the coolies would
only paddle lazily but regularly all would be
well, but they will not; they paddle all together
furiously for perhaps twenty or thirty strokes
and then vary between a haphazard rag-time
and doing nothing at all.</p>

<p class="p padl2">“Most of the time I watch the banks go by
and wonder how long it will take us to get to
the end of this reach, which bears a remarkable
resemblance to the last and to the next. The
jungle is as ugly as it can be, rank undergrowth,
trailing rattans and scraggy rotting trees. In
forty miles I do not think there are half a dozen
big trees worth looking at. Very occasionally
you see a flowering creeper, one with clusters of
white flowers is here and there, and I have seen
a few of the gorgeous flaming D’Albertis creeper
(<i>Mucuna pruriens</i>). Butterflies are seldom seen
and birds one hardly hears at all. The banks
are steep slimy brown mud, littered with the
trunks and limbs of rotten trees, which also
stick up all over the river like horrid muddy
bones.</p>

<p class="p padl2">“Altogether it is as gloomy and depressing as
it can be, there is no view, not even a glimpse
to shew that we are getting near a mountain
range. In the midst of all this it generally rains
hard and you arrive in camp soaking wet. Then
see everything taken out of the canoes, tents
pitched, canoes securely moored, food given out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>to the coolies, and by that time it is well on into
the afternoon. Wet wood is somehow coaxed
into boiling a kettle and I get a cup of tea, very
good. At six o’clock the meal of the day, rice
or a tin, but one eats very little on these journeys.
After dinner a book and tobacco and to bed about
nine o’clock, or earlier if the mosquitoes are
troublesome. It does not compare favourably
with being ‘on safari’ in Africa, and I frequently
wish myself back on one of those interminable
roads which I have so often cursed.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRDS</div>

<p>But it must not be supposed that there were not
occasional pleasant moments, which to some extent
were compensation for the monotony of those days.
Sometimes you saw a Crowned Pigeon (<i>Goura sclateri</i>)
by the water’s edge, and by paddling quietly you could
approach within a few yards before it flew lazily across
the river and alighted on a low branch. The Crowned
Pigeon is one of the handsomest of New Guinea birds;
it is as big as a large domestic fowl, of an uniform mauve
grey colour with a large white patch on the wings, and
on its head is a crest of delicate grey plumes, which it
opens and shuts like a fan. These birds feed mostly
on fruits, but they also eat small molluscs and crabs,
which they pick up on the river bank. As they were
almost the only eatable birds in the country, we killed
a good many of them, but their numbers appeared to
be in no way diminished when we left the country;
the flesh is white and excessively dry.</p>

<p class="caption">A PAPUAN OF MIMIKA WITH CLOSELY PLAITED HAIR.</p></div>

<p>The little red King Bird of Paradise (<i>Cicinnurus
regius</i>) is heard calling everywhere, and from the upper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>waters of the river you hear the harsh cry of the Greater
Bird of Paradise (<i>Paradisea novae guineae</i>), but both
of these are birds of the dense forest and I do not
remember ever having seen one from the river.</p>

<p>Green and red Eclectus Parrots (<i>Eclectus pectoralis</i>)
and white Lemon-crested Cockatoos are fairly numerous
and their harsh screams, though sufficiently unpleasing
are a welcome interruption of the prevailing
silence.</p>

<p>Lories were not often seen on the river journeys,
but they were extremely common near Wakatimi, where
a certain clump of trees was used by them as a regular
roosting-place. For an hour or more before sunset
countless hundreds of Lories (<i>Eos fuscata</i>) flew in flocks
from all directions towards the roosting-trees, chattering
loudly as they flew and even louder after they had
perched. Often a branch would give way under the
living weight and then the whole throng would rise
in the air again and circle round and round before they
alighted once more and the shouting and chattering
continued until it was dark.</p>

<p>Crocodiles were very seldom seen, but Iguanas of
two or three feet in length were often seen sunning
themselves on a log or a stump, from which they would
splash hurriedly into the water as the canoes approached.
Several times at night I heard a splash as loud as the
plunge of a man into water, but I could never discover
what was the animal that caused it; there may yet
possibly be some large unknown reptile in the river.
Snakes were sometimes seen curled up in the overhanging
vegetation and very commonly they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
found swimming in the water; one day I counted eleven
small harmless snakes swimming within half a mile of
the same place.</p>

<p>On many days during the months of May and June
the river swarmed with large bright yellow flies very
similar to, but about twice the size of, the Green Drake
of the fly-fisher. They hatched out about mid-day
and took longer or shorter flights over the water, rising
from it and alighting again like miniature aeroplanes.
Many of them fell a prey to swallows and bee-eaters
and other insect-eating birds, while the rest were quickly
drowned, and I have seen long stretches of the river
completely covered by the dead insects.</p>

<p>At some of the camps on the river and elsewhere
we were a good deal bothered by small bees, the Stingless
Honey-bee (<i>Melipona praeterita</i>). These annoying
little creatures—they are about half the size of the
common house-fly—buzzed about you in swarms and
strove most persistently to settle on any exposed part
of your body in pursuit of the sweat, which is never
absent from you in those places. No matter how you
beat about and killed them they were back again immediately
and once, while writing, I kept my hands
quite still on the book and in a few moments I counted
forty-six on my two hands before their crawling became
unbearable. They have a disagreeably sticky feeling
as they crawl over you and your hands, when you have
squashed a number of them, become sticky too.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NIGHT ON THE RIVER</div>

<p>At night, when the rain was not drumming ceaselessly
on the roof of the tent, the silence was broken
now and then by the grating call of a Brush Turkey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
(<i>Talegallus fuscirostris</i>)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>; or a flock of Pale Crows
(<i>Gymnocorax senex</i>), which are curiously nocturnal in
their habits, would fly over the camp cawing like muffled
rooks. Lizards and frogs uttered all sorts of strange
cries and whistles, and the mournful unbirdlike note
of the Frogmouth (<i>Podargus papuensis</i>) was heard on
every side.</p>

<p>Sometimes, even when there was no wind stirring,
you would hear at night a noise like thunder as some
great tree went crashing down. Most of the trees in
the jungle do not attain a very great girth, but they
grow up very rapidly to reach the light and in their
upper branches there is soon accumulated a dense mass
of climbers and parasitic plants, which in the course
of time become too heavy for the tree and cause it
to collapse. The floor of the jungle is strewn with the
limbs and trunks of fallen trees and the smell of rotting
wood is everywhere.</p>

<p>The last, usually the fifth, day of the journey up
the river was always pleasant, partly because one knew
that there were only a few more hours of the tedious
voyage, and partly because the scenery was beginning
to change. Beautiful Tree-ferns appeared upon the
banks and the soil, firmer than in the swampy lands
near the coast, supported trees of finer growth. Scattered
pebbles and then banks of clean sand and shingle began
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>to take the place of the hideous mud of the lower river,
and after spending, as frequently happened, many
weeks at Wakatimi, where the smallest pebble would
have been an object of wonder, it was a peculiar pleasure
to feel the grit of stones under your feet again. At
the same time the cocoa-brown water became clear
and sparkling and one drank it for the very pleasure
of drinking. Going further we came to rapids, where
the river ran over stones, or piled-up barriers of fallen
trees. Passages were cut through many of these
obstacles, but every succeeding flood brought down
more trees and new barriers were formed.</p>

<p>When the river was low, the last four miles to
Parimau were covered by wading and hauling the canoes
over or under the great logs. Every man had to get
out of the canoe and do his share of the work, and
sometimes we had to take the cargo out as well, when
the canoe had to be dragged over a particularly high
obstacle. When the river was in flood, the last day’s
journey was the most arduous of all, and it sometimes
took twelve or fourteen hours’ hard labour to accomplish it.
The water was then too deep for poling, and
the current was so swift that vigorous paddling hardly
did more than prevent the canoe from following the
stream, and it was only by dodging from one side of
the river to the other and by hauling on overhanging
branches that progress was made.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Head-dresses made of plaited fibres, worn at festivals and
ceremonies. 1. is ornamented with tufts of plumes of the
Greater Bird of Paradise.</span></p></div>

<p>Considering the want of skill of the coolies and
the great number of journeys that were made up and
down the river, it was wonderful that no accidents of
any consequence occurred. It is true that a good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>many canoes capsized—I think all of us had at least
one involuntary ducking—but a well-laden canoe is
comparatively steady, and most of the upsets happened
to empty canoes going down the river and nothing
was lost but coolies’ scanty baggage, which was
easily replaced. The Javanese coolies of the escort,
who were even less skilled watermen than ours, suffered
rather more accidents, but one boat-load of provisions
and two rifles were the total of their losses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LONG WET SEASON</div>

<p>There were periods, lasting for several weeks, when
the river was almost continually in flood, and there
were other, but always shorter, periods when the
river was low; but though we spent fifteen months in
New Guinea the time was not long enough to determine
at all accurately the limits of the seasons, for the first
three months of 1911 differed considerably from the
corresponding months of the previous year. Speaking
generally, it may be said of the Mimika district that
the weather from mid-October to the middle of April is
finer than the weather from the middle of April to the
middle of October. These two periods correspond more
or less with the monsoons, but it is notable that whereas
in British New Guinea the period of the Eastern monsoon,
May to November, is the drier, here the reverse
is the case. The finest weather appears to be in
November and December, and the wettest weather
is in July, August and September. The terms “fine”
and “wet” are used only relatively, for it is almost
always wet. In the first twelve months of our stay
rain fell on three hundred and thirty days. It was
very unfortunate that we did not provide ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
with rain-gauges for use at Wakatimi and Parimau,
where interesting observations might have been recorded
for a year or more. A roughly constructed rain-gauge,
which was used for a short time, more than once recorded
a fall of over six inches of rain in one night,
and that was in the comparatively dry season of March.</p>

<p>A great deal of the rain fell in thunderstorms.
From January 4th, 1910, to January 4th, 1911, I heard
thunder on two hundred and ninety-five days, not
including days on which I saw distant lightning but did
not hear the thunder.</p>

<p>Before we left England it was thought that the
party ought to include a geologist, but it was impossible
to add to our numbers, which were already sufficiently
great. As it fell out, we hardly reached geological
country at all and a geologist would have spent an idle
time, but there would have been plenty of occupation
for a well equipped hydrologist.</p>

<p>The winds, whether from the East or from the West,
were very variable both in force and constancy. Sometimes
there would blow a fierce wind for two or three
days followed by several days of calm. At other times
a steady wind would blow for two or three weeks and
so great would be the surf on the sea-shore that no
ship could approach the mouth of the river. The
wind usually dropped before sunset and the nights were
calm.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HALLEY’S COMET</div>

<p>It followed naturally from the heavy rainfall that
the nights were seldom clear, and at one time Marshall
waited for three months before he could take an observation
from a star. But there were times even in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
wet weather, when the rain poured down during the
day and at night the heavens were clear. One of these
times fortunately occurred in May, when Halley’s Comet
was approaching the Earth. On May 9th the comet,
looking like a muffled star, was seen in the East and its
tail, a broad beam of brilliant light, extended upwards
through about thirty degrees. Below the comet and
a little to the South of it Venus shone like a little moon,
appearing far bigger than any planet I have ever seen.
The comet grew enormously and in the early morning
of May 14th, the last time that we saw it completely
before it had passed the Earth, the tail blazed across
the heavens like an immense search-light beam to the
zenith and beyond. On May 26th it appeared again
in the evening, reduced in size to about forty-five
degrees, and several nights we watched it growing always
smaller, until it vanished from our sight. Superlative
expressions will not describe Halley’s Comet as we
saw it in New Guinea; it was a wonderful appearance
and one never to be forgotten. Our coolies and the
Javanese declared that it portended much sickness
and death. Though we tried to question them about
it, we never learnt how it impressed the minds of the
natives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> the end of January Capt. Rawling, who had
gone up the Mimika River with the first party to Parimau,
made an excursion to the N.W. of that place, and at
a distance of about four miles he came to a river, which
we afterwards learnt to know as the Kapare, of much
greater volume than the Mimika, and therefore likely to
spring from mountains much higher than those that gave
rise to the Mimika. Had we known at the time that
our real objective, the highest mountains of the range,
lay far to the N.E., we should have neglected the Kapare
River, and by so doing we should have spared ourselves
many weeks of labour; but at the same time we should
have missed seeing a wide area of unknown country,
and we might possibly have failed to make the discovery
of the pygmy tribe, who inhabit the hilly country between
the Kapare and the upper waters of the Mimika River.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p082.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="UPPER WATERS OF THE KAPARE RIVER" />
<p class="caption">UPPER WATERS OF THE KAPARE RIVER. MOUNT TAPIRO IN DISTANCE.</p></div>

<p>It appeared that the Kapare might offer a better
route to the higher mountains than the Mimika, so it
was decided that we should explore its lower waters
and see whether it was possible to reach it from our base-camp.
Accordingly on February 14th Lieut. Cramer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>Marshall and I set out in three canoes, taking with us
provisions sufficient for a week’s journey. Two miles
below Wakatimi we entered and began to ascend the
Watuka River, of which, as has been noted above (p. <a href="#Page_40">40</a>),
the Mimika is but a tributary. After proceeding a mile
or two up the Watuka we came to another junction
of two rivers, and for the first time we began to realise
the extraordinary network of waterways, which traverse
the low-lying lands of that part of New Guinea. We
learnt afterwards that there are inland channels joining
several of the rivers to the East of the Mimika in such a
way that it is possible to travel by water from Wakatimi
to villages far distant along the coast without going by
sea, and no doubt the same is true in a Westerly direction.</p>

<p>The junction we had then reached was formed by a
wide river coming, apparently, from due North and a
much smaller branch, not more than ten yards wide,
but deep and swift, joining it from the West. It appeared
to be quite certain that the river we were in search of
must be the Northern branch, and we should have
followed it at once had not a number of natives appeared
on the bank, and asked us to go and visit their village,
which, they explained, was a short distance up the
Western branch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VISIT TO OBOTA</div>

<p>We soon reached Obota, as the village was called, a
collection of about one hundred huts on both banks
of the narrow river, and there we were accorded the
usual welcome by a large crowd of people. As it was still
early in the day we were anxious to continue our journey,
and we proposed to go up the Northern branch, but the
natives assured us that that led to nowhere and broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
up into branches in the jungle, while the small stream
which flowed through the village was the river flowing
directly from the mountains.</p>

<p>It should be explained that this information was
conveyed to us partly by long speeches of which we
understood little or nothing, but chiefly by means of
maps drawn on the ground. Some of the men drew
their rivers crossing one another in a rather improbable
manner, but many of them drew charts very intelligently,
and at different times we obtained from the natives a
good deal of geographical information which was substantially
correct. On this occasion their maps all
agreed in tracing the big river to branches in the jungle,
and the small river to the mountains, so we were rather
reluctantly persuaded that they were right, and we
tried to induce some of them to go with us. Many of
them offered to go the next day, but not one would
start then—it was too late, it was going to rain, they
had not eaten, and many other excuses—so we got
into our canoes and attempted to paddle up the stream
and found, what the natives doubtless knew, that we
could not advance at all. Several times we tried, but
were always driven back by the strong current, to the
great delight of the natives who lined the banks and
laughed at our feeble efforts, so there was nothing for
it but to make a camp near the village and wait till the
next day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RIVER OBSTACLES</div>

<p>There was some difficulty about inducing the men
to start in the morning, for it was raining, and, like
other naked peoples, the Papuans dislike being wetted
by rain, but we got off eventually with two natives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
one at the bow and one at the stern, in each canoe, in
addition to the crews of four Javanese soldiers and convicts.
It was soon evident that without the help of the
natives we could not possibly have ascended the river.
For a mile or two above Obota the water ran like a mill-race
in a very narrow channel full of rocks and sunken
trees, and it was only by the most skilful poling and,
when a chance occurred, by hauling the canoes along
a side channel that we were able to proceed. When
we returned a few days later, we skimmed in fifteen
minutes down the rapids which we had taken more than
three hours to ascend.</p>

<p>Above the rapids the river widened to about forty
yards and the strength of the current was proportionately
less, but in a few miles we met with another
difficulty. At a sharp bend of the river the whole
channel was blocked by an enormous barrier of huge
trunks and limbs of trees piled high upon each other
and wedged below into a solid mass. For larger boats
this might have meant a delay of many days spent in
cutting a channel, but the dug-out canoe is narrow and,
if not flexible, it can be squeezed through the most
unlikely openings, so that we passed the barrier without
the loss of many hours.</p>

<p>When we started from Obota we had been doubtful
whether it was possible that so small a river could
possibly come from the mountains; but a little way
above the barrier of logs our doubts were set at rest,
when we found that our river was a mere off-shoot
from another more than twice its volume, which flowed
down to the sea at a village called Periepia. The main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
river, the Kapare, where we joined it, was more than a
hundred yards wide, and in the next two days’ journey
it hardly diminished at all in size. The character of
the river differed markedly from that of the Mimika;
its bed was of sand, denoting its mountain origin, in
contrast to the brown mud of the Mimika and other
jungle rivers, and its course was a procession of magnificent
bends, quite unlike the paltry windings of the
Mimika.</p>

<p>Paddling slowly up the river we disturbed companies
of Hornbills (<i>Rhytidoceros plicatus</i>) which were
feeding at the tops of the trees. These peculiarly hideous
birds bark like dogs, and the loud “swishing” of their
wings, as they slowly take flight, has been likened (not
inaptly) to the starting puffs of a railway train. On
this and on the other rivers we were often pleasantly
reminded of home by the note of the Common Sandpiper
(<i>Totanus hypoleucus</i>) which seemed to be quite as much
at home in New Guinea as in its northern haunts. The
last of these were seen in early April, and they began to
reappear before the end of July. Very interesting birds,
of which we saw a great number on this river, are the
black and white Tree Ducks (<i>Tadorna radjah</i>). They
have the curious habit of perching very cleverly on the
topmost branches of the trees, and they make a pretty
whistling by night.</p>

<p class="caption">VEGETATION ON THE BANKS OF THE KAPARE RIVER.</p></div>

<p>There were no signs of human habitation along the
banks, until on the third day we came to a small village
of a dozen huts, in the middle of which was a tall house
built of bamboos, used for ceremonials and dancing.
The few people inhabiting the place were of a very low
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>order of intelligence, if one may judge from the apathy
with which they received us and saw us go on our way.</p>

<p>As we proceeded further, on the fourth day the river
became a good deal smaller, having derived several
tributaries from the low hills which were by that time
not far distant on the right bank, and as the current
became increasingly swifter it was evident that the
Kapare did not promise a better means of approach by
water to the mountains than the Mimika.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST PEBBLES</div>

<p>We were rather amused, when we came to the first
bank of shingle, by the natives who were with us bringing
us gifts of stones, as though they were something new
and rare: probably they thought that as we came, for
all they knew, from the sea, we had never seen such
things before.</p>

<p>On the fifth day we left the baggage behind and went
on in one unladen canoe, hoping to reach the point
where Rawling had met the Kapare River by walking
overland from the Mimika, but we were stopped a few
miles short of that place by heavy rapids, which
effectually prevented any further investigation of the
river.</p>

<p>The excursion up the Kapare was a further illustration,
if one had been needed, of the futility of undertaking
an expedition in that country without a steam
launch or motor-boat. When it was found that the
Mimika was only an insignificant river, which the first
excursion up it would have shown, the Kapare River
might have been explored from Periepia, a matter
which could have been done in two days instead of the
seven occupied by the journey in canoes, and after that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
other rivers to the East might have been explored until
one convenient for approaching the mountains had been
found.</p>

<p>After spending a night on a sand bank from which
we were very nearly washed away by a sudden flood,
we paddled leisurely down the river and came in one
day again to Obota. Though the two places are so close
together and communication between them is very frequent,
the inhabitants of Obota are a much better lot of
people than those of Wakatimi. The Obota men, who
came up the river with us, worked steadily for several
days, a thing we never could persuade the Wakatimi
men to do, and, a more striking sign of their superiority,
the Obota people cultivate the soil, whereas the Wakatimi
people never do anything of the kind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TOBACCO</div>

<p>Many acres of ground on both sides of the river were
cleared of bush and planted with bananas and sweet
potatoes; we never succeeded in obtaining any of the
latter, but bananas were brought for us to buy and in
the circumstances they seemed to us to be excellent.
The most extensive crop cultivated at Obota is tobacco;
they plant out the seedlings and shelter them with a
low roof of bent sticks covered with leaves, until the
young plants are strong enough to bear the full force of
the sun and rain. Almost every native smokes, men and
women, and very often the children. A small handful
of the dried leaves is taken and very carefully rolled
up in the form of a cigar, and then wrapped round with
a <i>sirih</i> leaf, which has been previously warmed over the
fire; the ends are bitten square, and sometimes the
leaf is tied round the middle with a thread of fibre to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
prevent its unrolling. The tobacco is strong in flavour,
but not at all unpleasant to smoke. The only other
place, except among the pygmy people of the hills,
where we found cultivation was up the Keaukwa River,
a few miles to the E. of the Mimika River.</p>

<p>The distribution of tobacco in New Guinea is rather
a puzzling question. There are many places on the
coast where its use was unknown until quite recently,
while at the same time the mountain people, for example,
in the Arfak Mountains and on the upper reaches of
the Fly and Kaiserin Augusta Rivers, have been accustomed
to cultivate it and to barter it with their neighbours
in the lowlands. The Tapiro pygmy people,
who live in the mountains, cultivate tobacco and exchange
it with the Papuans of the upper Mimika who grow
none themselves. These facts have led some people
to suppose that the tobacco plant is indigenous in New
Guinea.</p>

<p>The people of Obota were rich in worldly possessions,
for as we walked through the village we saw two Chinese
brass gongs and a large porcelain pot, which they told
us came from “Tarete.” It may be that at some time
a Malay or Arab trader from Ternate came over to this
part of the coast, but it is impossible to know; perhaps
the things had been stolen and exchanged from one
village to another, from the West end of the island,
which is often visited by Ternate traders.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAGO</div>

<p>But the chief reason for the prosperity of Obota is
the fact that it lies at the edge of an extensive sago
swamp, and sago is the mainstay of the food of the
Papuans. Sago is made from a palm (<i>Sagus rumphii</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
which always grows in wet places, generally in low ground
near the sea, and it will even grow where the water is
brackish.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The palm is thicker than a man’s body,
and its height is about 25 or 30 feet. The trunk is
covered with large leaves bearing long hard spines. A
mature tree produces a large vertical spike of flowers
and then dies. When they wish to collect sago, the
natives cut down a full-grown palm and clear it of its
leaves and leaf-sheaths. A wide strip of the bark is
then cut off from the side of the tree which lies uppermost
and the sago is exposed. The bark of the tree is really
nothing more than a shell about an inch in thickness,
enclosing the pith or sago, which is a brownish pulpy
substance separated by fibrous strands. The pith is
separated from the bark by means of the sago-beater,
which is a sort of wooden hammer made in two pieces,
a handle about a foot and a half long, carrying a head
about twelve inches long; the hitting face of the head
is about two inches in diameter, and it often bears a
rather sharp rim which is useful in clearing the pith from
the bark.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p090.jpg" width="400" height="513" alt="PAPUAN WOMAN CARRYING WOODEN BOWL OF SAGO." />
<p class="caption">PAPUAN WOMAN CARRYING WOODEN BOWL OF SAGO.</p></div>

<p>When all the pith has been beaten out of the shell
of the tree it is carried away to the nearest water, where
the sago is extracted. A trough made of two wide
basin-like leaf-bases of the sago palm is set up on
crossed sticks about three feet from the ground in such a
way that one basin is a little higher than the other.
Lumps of the pith are then kneaded in the upper part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>of the trough with water which is constantly poured
into it; the water carries away the sago into the lower
part of the trough, and nothing remains above but the
coarse fibrous stuff which is thrown away; the lower
trough gradually becomes filled with sago and the
water flows away. The sago, a dirty white substance
with a rather sour smell, is made into cylindrical cakes of
about 30 lbs. weight, and neatly wrapped up in leaves
of the palm to be carried back to the village. Most
of the work of collecting and preparing the sago is done
by the women.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Wallace, one fair-sized sago palm
will supply one man with food for a year, so it will be
seen that the amount of labour required to feed a
community in a district where sago is plentiful is not
very overwhelming.</p>

<p>The usual method of cooking employed by the
Papuans is to roll the sago into lumps about the size
of a cricket ball and roast them in the embers of a fire.
On one or two occasions I saw them prepare it in a
different way, which was to wrap up the sago in
banana leaves and cook it on hot stones; the result
was probably more wholesome food than the charred
lumps that they usually eat.</p>

<p>Very often the natives of the Mimika eat the crude
sago, that is to say, the pith simply as it is cut out of
the tree, without having been washed or pounded. The
stuff is roasted in the usual way and the separation
of the sago is done in the mouth of the eater, who
spits out the uneatable fibre.</p>

<p>As well as providing the Papuans with the bulk of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
their food, the sago palm supplies them with excellent
building poles in the mid-ribs of the leaves, which
are straight and very strong, and are sometimes fifteen
to twenty feet long, and the leaflets themselves are used
for making “atap” in the districts where the <i>Nipa</i>
palm is not found.</p>

<p>It was mentioned above that the crews of our canoes
on the excursion up the Kapare River were made up
of Javanese soldiers and convicts. Our first batch of
Ambonese coolies had by that time failed us, so Lieut.
Cramer very kindly lent us some of his men for the
occasion, and we had an opportunity of testing their
worth. Speaking generally, it is not unfair to them
to say that the Javanese are wholly unsuited to rough
work in a savage country; they are a peaceful race
of peasants and their proper place is in the rice fields.
As soldiers they appear to the civilian eye to be clodhoppers
masquerading in (usually misfitting) uniform.
They have no military bearing and no alertness, and
one ceases to wonder that when the Netherlands East
Indian native army is almost exclusively composed
of Javanese, the war-like people of Atjeh have kept
the field for so many years. It is a matter for surprise
that the Dutch do not enlist more of the warlike Bugis
of Celebes, and natives of the Moluccas, and even the
Achinese prisoners themselves; ten thousand of such
men would surely be of more worth than the 30,000
Javanese who fill the ranks of their native army. Of
course there are exceptions; there are men among
them who have performed splendidly valorous deeds
in time of war; but the majority are of a stuff of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
which it would be impossible to make soldiers, they
are soft and unathletic and of a curiously feminine
form of body, as a glance at a group of bathing
Javanese will show.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVICT LABOUR</div>

<p>The Javanese convicts were the same sort of material,
but their case was not quite the same as that of the
soldiers, for they had not voluntarily entered a profession
(if the condition of convict can be called a
profession) that involved service in foreign lands. The
justice of the Dutch practice of employing convicts
as coolies in military and exploring expeditions is very
much open to question, but it need not be discussed
at length here. The transport for the military operations
in Atjeh is carried out almost entirely by convict
labour, and all the Dutch exploring parties in New
Guinea have made use of convict coolies, assisted in
two instances by paid Dayaks. It is intended officially
that only long-sentence men shall go on expeditions,
so that by good behaviour they may earn some substantial
remission of their sentences, but that is not
invariably the case, for several young men left our
expedition because their terms had expired. It is also
supposed that only men shall be sent on expeditions
who volunteer to go; but the supply of convict volunteers
is not inexhaustible, and there were men with
us whose last wish would have been to come to New
Guinea.</p>

<p>But even if they were all volunteers and all long-service
men, it is doubtful whether it is justifiable to
send any but free men to work in a country so full of
risks as New Guinea. The native of Java is a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
creature, particularly susceptible to beri-beri and other
diseases of the tropics, and when I saw convicts die,
as did unfortunately happen, I came to the conclusion
that the balance went heavily against the system. It
must, however, be recorded that the convicts are
extremely well treated. Except in the matter of pay—convicts
on expeditions receive about one guilder
(1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>) a month—they are treated in all essentials
exactly like the native soldiers; they have the same
rations of food and the same tent accommodation,
and many of them enjoy themselves a good deal more
than if they were occupied in sweeping the roads in a
town in Java. Their hours of labour in camp are
comparatively short, and the loads they are given to
carry on the march are by no means excessive. Nothing
could exceed the kindness of Cramer’s treatment of the
men under his command, and I have no doubt that the
same may be said of the treatment of convicts elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> native village of Wakatimi lay directly opposite
to our base-camp on the W. bank of the Mimika,
which was there about 150 yards broad. Beyond
the margin of the river was a strip of grass intersected
by muddy creeks, where the natives moored their canoes,
and beyond that was Wakatimi. The village consisted
of a single street about two hundred yards long lined
on one side by huts, which usually numbered about
sixty. But occasionally, as for instance when we first
arrived, and once or twice subsequently when large
crowds of natives from other villages visited the place,
it happened that the street was a double row of houses,
and every available spot of dry ground was occupied.</p>

<p>Shifting house is a very simple affair, as most of
the building materials are carried about in the canoes,
and the canoes come and go in the most casual and
unaccountable manner. Sometimes there were perhaps
a thousand people at Wakatimi, and then there would
be days when there was not a soul in the village. There
were times when for weeks together there were large
villages at the mouth of the river, and there were other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
times when the coast was utterly deserted and hardly
a trace of the villages remained. We were never able
to learn what it was that prompted these migrations
of the natives, but it is probable that the pursuit of
food was the guiding motive. The wandering habits
of the people will certainly make it very difficult to
administer the country and civilise the people, if an
attempt to do so is ever made.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THEIR HOUSES</div>

<p>The typical native house of the Mimika district is
a simple rectangular structure with a framework of
light poles driven into the ground, the cross-pieces
and roof pole being tied to the uprights by strands of
rattan. In some houses the roof is a simple slope
downwards from front to back, but in most cases there
is a central ridge pole from which the roof slopes to
the back and front, that at the back being longer and
going lower than that in front. The height of the ridge
is about eight feet; after we had been for some time in
the country the people improved their building in
imitation of our houses and built their huts ten, and
even twelve feet high. The roof is made of “atap,”
the thatch described above (p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>), and the walls are
mats made from the leaves of a Screw-pine (<i>Pandanus</i>).
The area of an average hut is about 9 by 12 feet, the
longer dimensions being from front to back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p096.jpg" width="500" height="307" alt="PAPUAN HOUSES ON THE MIMIKA." />
<p class="caption">PAPUAN HOUSES ON THE MIMIKA.</p></div>

<p>The floor is covered with sand to a depth of several
inches, which is prevented from escaping into the street
by a board placed on its edge along the front of the
hut. The sand is brought from the seashore and must
be of great value in preserving the health of the people:
the huts are frequently under water in the big floods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>and without the sand, which quickly dries, it would
be impossible for them to live there. Unfortunately
the sand aggravates the sores and ulcers from which
too many of them suffer, but that is perhaps a lesser
evil than always sleeping on sodden ground. Racks
made of sticks, on which are stowed bundles of arrows,
spears, clubs, tobacco, sago and all the other portable
property of the family, extend from one wall to another,
so that it is almost impossible to stand upright inside
a hut. The door is an opening about two feet square
in the front wall; as well as being the means of entrance
for the members of the household the door serves as
the principal means of escape for the smoke of the fire,
which is constantly kept burning inside.</p>

<p>It is only rarely that a house remains for long
separated from others; when a second house is built
it is attached to the side of the first, and the dividing
wall is removed. In a large village the houses are built
in rows of varying length, according to the nature of
the ground, and there may be as many as fifty or
sixty joined together. If you go inside you find that it
is a single long house without any dividing walls, but
each family keeps to its own particular section and
use its own private entrance. When the place is
crowded with people, and a number of fires are burning,
the atmosphere inside the house may be more readily
imagined than described.</p>

<p>The feature that most distinguishes Wakatimi from
all the other villages that we saw is its fine grove of
coconut palms. The village street is bordered with
them on the side opposite to the houses, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
must be three or four hundred trees in all. They afford
a very pleasant shade to the village, and their graceful
trunks curving this way and that are really picturesque
and conveniently relieve the ugliness of the Papuan
houses. It is rather dangerous to live so close to coconut
trees, and sometimes when the wind blew in gusts
before the rain we heard warning shouts and the heavy
thud of a nut falling to the ground; but accidents
never seemed to happen. The nuts are, of course, a
source of great wealth to the Wakatimi people, who
exchange them for bananas and tobacco with the
people of Obota, and while we were in the country
they brought us altogether thousands of nuts for which
they received riches undreamt of before. At one or two
places near the sea, and at several places on the Mimika
River we found coconut palms, but far up the river
they did not occur, nor did we see any on the Kapare
River; and I believe all those we saw were planted
by the natives, and that none of them were self-sown.</p>

<p>The method of cultivation is extremely simple.
A ripe nut is left out on the roof of a hut and allowed
to sprout; when the shoot is about a foot or more in
length, a small patch of ground is cleared, preferably
in a sandy place on the river bank or near the sea shore,
a hole is dug and the sprouting nut is planted. From
time to time, if he remembers to do so, the native will
clear away the strangling vegetation from the young
plant, and in about five years, under favourable conditions,
the palm begins to bear fruit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRUNKENNESS</div>

<p>Growing commonly near Wakatimi is another
species of palm, which, though it has not the value<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
of the coconut palm, is yet more prized by the natives.
This is the Sugar palm (<i>Arenga saccharifera</i>), and from
it is made a very potent and intoxicating liquor.
When the palm is in fruit—it bears a heavy bunch
of dark green fruit—a cut is made in the stem below
the stalk of the fruit, and the juice trickles out and
is collected in the shell of a coconut. Apparently the
juice ferments very rapidly without the addition of
any other substance, for it is drunk almost as soon as
it is collected and the native becomes horribly intoxicated.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks of our stay in the
country the people were on their good behaviour, or
else they found sufficient amusement in coming to see
us and our works, but they soon tired of that and went
back to their normal habits. Many of them went to
the drinking places by day, and we often saw them
lying or sitting at the foot of the tree, while one of their
party stood at the top of a bamboo ladder collecting
the palm wine. But the worst was a small gang of
about a dozen men, the laziest in the village, whose
custom it was to start off towards evening in canoes
to their favourite drinking tree, where they spent the
night drinking and making night hideous with their
songs and shouts. In the morning they returned raving
to the village and as often as not they started quarrelling
and fighting and knocking the houses to pieces
(a favourite occupation of the angry Papuan) before
they settled down to sleep off the effects of their
potations.</p>

<p>As a rule, the men were the worst offenders, and
the women drank but seldom, but I well remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
one day seeing a man and his wife both hopelessly
drunk come over to our camp. It was pouring with
rain and their canoe was several inches deep in water,
but they danced up and down in it and sang a drunken
ditty; it was a ludicrous and at the same time heart-rending
exhibition. The man, when we first knew
him, was a fine fellow who one day climbed up a palm
tree to get us coconuts, a feat which no man out of
condition can perform; a few months later he was
hardly ever seen sober, and in January he died. A
smiling round-faced youth called Ukuma, who was one
of our particular friends at first and was privileged
to wander where he liked about the camp, attached
himself to the drinking party, and before we left the
country he looked an old man, and I had difficulty in
recognising him.</p>

<p>Though the drunken vagaries of the natives were
usually food for tears, they sometimes provided us
with amusement. One afternoon one of the principal
men of Wakatimi came down to the river bank quite
intoxicated and took a canoe, which he paddled out
into mid-stream and there moored it. From there
he proceeded to shoot arrows vaguely and promiscuously
at the village, raving and shouting what sounded to be
horrible curses. Some of the arrows fell into the village
and some sailed over the palm trees, and now and
again he turned round and shot harmlessly into our
camp, but nobody took the slightest notice of him
except his wife, who went down to the river bank and
told him in plain language her opinion of him. This
caused him to turn his attention to her, but his aim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>was wild and the arrows missed their mark, so he
desisted and went back to the shore, where the woman
broke across her knee the remainder of his bundle of
arrows, while he cooled his fevered brow in the river.
Then, while she delivered a further lecture, he followed
her back to their hut looking like a whipped and
ashamed dog. It can hardly be doubted that palm
wine shortens the lives of many of the Papuans, but
one must hesitate before condemning an absolutely
untaught and savage race for excessive indulgence in
one of the pleasures that vary their monotonous lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRUITS</div>

<p>As well as coconuts the Mimika people have also
bananas, papayas (<i>Carica papaya</i>), water-melons and
pumpkins, all of them of a very inferior kind. It
cannot be said that they cultivate these fruits; they
occasionally get a banana shoot and plant it in the
ground by the riverside, where it may or may not grow
and produce fruit, but they make no clearings and take
very little trouble to ensure the life of the plant. The
papayas and the melons and pumpkins are sometimes
seen growing about the native dwellings; but they, too,
seem to be there more by accident than by any design
on the part of the people. At Obota we found a few
pineapples, which were probably the descendants of
some that were brought to the Mimika by M. Dumas
a few years earlier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LANGUAGE DIFFICULTIES</div>

<p>It has been stated in the previous chapters that
the natives told us this or that, and that we asked
them for information about one thing or another.
From this the reader must not conclude that we acquired
a very complete knowledge of the native language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
for that, unfortunately, was not the case, and even
at the end of the fifteen months that we spent in their
country we were not able to converse with them.
Lieutenant Cramer and I compiled a vocabulary of
nearly three hundred words,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and we talked a good
deal with the people, but we never reached the position
of being able to exchange ideas on any single subject.</p>

<p>In the Eastern and Northern parts of New Guinea
it has always been found possible to communicate with
the natives through the medium of some known
language; even if there were many differences noticed
in the language of a new district, there were always
some common words which formed the foundation of
a more complete understanding. The Western end
of New Guinea has been for centuries visited by traders
speaking Malay dialects, some of whom have settled in
the country; or Papuans from those parts have
travelled to Malay-speaking islands and have returned
with a sufficient knowledge of the language to act as
interpreters to people visiting those districts.</p>

<p>But the long stretch of the South-west coast from
the MacCluer Gulf as far as the Fly River has been
quite neglected by Malay-speaking traders, partly on
account of the poverty of the country and partly by
reason of the shallow sea and the frequent storms which
make navigation difficult and dangerous, so that the
Malay language was of no use to us as a means of talking
with the natives. It is true that two men from the
Mimika district had been taken a few years previously
to Fak-fak, the Dutch Government post on the South
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>side of the MacCluer Gulf, but though they spent two
years there and attempts were made to teach them
Malay, in 1910 the extent of their knowledge of the
language was the two words <i>Tida, tuan</i> (No, master).</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that there is no common language
along the S. coast, nor even a language with words
common to all the dialects in use. We were visited
on one occasion by the Dutch Assistant Resident
from Fak-fak; the native interpreter who came with
him, and who knew all the native dialects of the Fak-fak
district, could not understand one word of the Mimika
language. On another occasion some natives from
Mimika were taken down by steamer to Merauke, the
Government post in S.W. New Guinea, not far from
the boundary of British Papua, and there they found
the language of the natives quite unintelligible to them.</p>

<p>So we found ourselves confronted with the task of
learning a language with neither grammar, dictionary
nor interpreter. This may not seem to be an insuperable
difficulty, nor is it perhaps where Europeans
and educated people are concerned, but with Papuans
it is a very different problem. The first thing to do—and
very few of them would even grasp the idea—is
to make them understand that you wish to learn their
words. You may point at an object and look intelligent
and expectant, but they are slow to take your
meaning, and they soon tire of giving information.
The facial expression, which amongst us conveys even
to a deaf man an interrogation, means nothing to them,
nor has the sideways shake of the head a negative
meaning to Papuans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>In trying to learn a new language of this kind most
people (I imagine) would begin, as we did, with the
numerals. But our researches in this direction did not
take us very far, for we made the interesting discovery
that they have words for one and two only; <i>ínakwa</i>
(one), <i>jamaní</i> (two). This is not to say that they cannot
reckon beyond two, for they can, by using the fingers
and thumbs, and beginning always with the thumb
of the right hand, reckon with tolerable accuracy up to
ten. For numbers above ten they use the toes, never,
so far as we observed, two or three toes, but always
all the toes together to indicate a large but uncertain
number. Sometimes they opened and closed the fingers
of both hands two or three times and uttered the word
<i>takirí</i>, which appeared to mean “many.” They did
not, as some people do, use the word which means
“hand” to indicate five or a quantity of about that
number.</p>

<p>With patience we learnt a great number of substantives,
the names of animals, the parts of the body,
the various possessions of the natives and so forth, and
with more difficulty we learnt some of the active verbs.
But when we came to abstract ideas, our researches
ceased abruptly for lack of the question words, who,
how, where, when, etc.; these we were never able to
learn, and it is impossible to act them.</p>

<p>Thus we were never able to find out what they
thought of various things; we could point to the moon
and be told its name, but we were never able to say,
“What is the moon?” We learnt the names of lightning
and thunder, but we never knew who they thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
produced them. We could not find out where their
stone axes came from, nor how old they were, nor who
made them; and a hundred other questions, which
we should have liked to put, remained unanswered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OBTAINING INFORMATION</div>

<p>These limitations of our knowledge of the language
were particularly annoying when we tried to find out
the simplest ties of relationship. It may be thought
very unintelligent of us that we never learnt the word
for father, in spite of many attempts to do so. If
you pointed to a child and asked a man, knowing him
to be the father, what the child was, he would slap
himself on the chest and answer, “<i>Dorota kamare</i>” (my
penis); then if you pointed to himself he would tell
you his own name, but never any word that could
possibly be construed as father. If you tried the same
thing with the mother she would point to the child and
say, “<i>Dorota auwë</i>” (my breast). The child on being
questioned pointed to the father and always said his
name, the mother it would call <i>Aína</i> (woman), but
perhaps this word also means mother.</p>

<p>There were two men at Parimau so much alike as
to be unmistakably brothers; we learnt their names
and that they were <i>Inakwa kamare</i> (one penis), but
we never found out the name of their relationship.</p>

<p>Seeing that some of the people have a very good
idea of drawing on the ground a map of the country,
I tried one day a graphic method of obtaining the
relationships of a man whose name and whose wife’s
name and son’s name I knew. I put sticks on the
ground to represent him and his wife and son, and then
in a tentative sort of way put in a stick to represent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
father, whose name he mentioned, but the game did
not interest him and my researches came to an end.</p>

<p>Even the apparently simple matter of enquiring
the names of places is not so easy as one would think.
When the first party went up the Mimika to Parimau
they pointed to the huts and asked what the village
was called; the answer given was “Tupué,” meaning
I believe, the name of the family who lived in the huts
pointed at. For several months we called the place
Tupué, and the name appeared in various disguises
in the English newspapers. When I was at Parimau
in July, it occurred to me to doubt the name of Tupué,
which we never heard the natives use, so I questioned
a man elaborately. Pointing in the direction of Wakatimi,
I said in his language: “Many houses, Wakatimi,”
and he nodded assent; then pointing in the direction
of another village that we had visited I said: “Many
houses, Imah,” to which he agreed; then I said.
“Many houses,” and pointed towards Parimau. This
performance was repeated three times before he understood
my intention and supplied the word “Parimau,”
and then he shouted the whole story across the river
to the people in the village who received it with shouts
of laughter, and well they might. It was as if a
foreigner, who had been living for six months in a place
which he was accustomed to call Smith, enquired again
one day what its name was and found that it was
London.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LANGUAGE OF MIMIKA</div>

<p>The language spoken by the people of Mimika is by
no means unpleasant to listen to, and with the customary
sing-song intonation it would be almost musical, if it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>were not for the harsh voices of the natives, both men
and women. There are many agreeably soft gutterals,
and there is no hissing sound in the language, as they
are unable to pronounce the letter “s.” Many of
their words are really very pleasing, notably some of
their names, such as “Oonabë,” “Inamë,” “Tébo,”
“Magena,” “Awariao,” “Idoriaota,” “Poandio,” and
“Mareru,” to mention only a few; some of the names
were so long that I never succeeded in writing them
correctly.</p>

<p>The people who lived near the upper waters of the
Mimika appeared to speak the same dialect as those
living near the coast, with one noticeable difference.
Those words containing a “k” in the language of the
people at the coast lose the “k” in the mouths of the
up-river natives, thus: <i>Ké</i> (rain) in the Wakatimi
language becomes <i>’é</i> at Parimau; <i>Kie</i> (a leech) becomes
<i>’ie</i>, <i>Pokanë</i> (an axe) becomes <i>Po’anë</i>.</p>

<p>The only rule of grammar that we learnt was the
simple method of constructing the possessive case by
adding the suffix <i>ta</i>. Thus from <i>doro</i> (I) you have
<i>dorota</i> (mine); from <i>oro</i> (you), <i>orota</i> (your), and in the
same way <i>Tebota</i> (Tebo’s); <i>Mareruta</i> (Mareru’s), and
so on.</p>

<p>They were curious to know our names and liked to
address us by them; Goodfellow’s and Rawling’s names
baffled them completely; Marshall’s became “Martë”;
they made a good attempt at mine in “Wollatona,”
and Cramer’s they pronounced perfectly.</p>

<p>So far as I know, they never finish a word with a
consonant, and when they adopted a Malay or Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
word which ended in a consonant, they always added
a vowel; for instance, <i>tuana</i> (master), <i>Kapítana</i> (Captain),
<i>maíora</i> (Major).</p>

<p>Some of their newly-constructed words will puzzle
future philologists who go there; for instance, the
Malay word <i>písau</i> (a knife) they called <i>pítau</i>, substituting
“t” for the “s” which they cannot pronounce;
<i>petau</i> was found easier to say than <i>pítau</i>, and eventually
it became changed to <i>pauti</i>, which was the finally accepted
version.</p>

<p>Probably the best means of learning the local dialect
would be to encourage an intelligent child to visit
your camp daily, where it would learn Malay and in
course of time might be able to act as interpreter; but
the process of education would be a slow one, and it
would be constantly interrupted by the wandering
habits of the natives. The time that we spent in the
country was too short for any such attempt to be
made, and indeed it was not until we had been there
for several months that the children came fearlessly
into our camp. But now that the natives have full
confidence in Europeans a patient scholar might make
a complete study of a quite unknown language.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Papuans of the Mimika district may be divided
into two classes or tribes: those who live in the
villages on the lower waters of the river and make
periodical migrations to the sea; and those who live
on the upper waters of the river near the foot of the
mountains and who never go down to the coast.
There is a wide interval of uninhabitable country
between the regions occupied by these two tribes, and
communication between them, if it takes place at all,
is very rare; but they resemble each other so closely,
both in physical characters and in their manners and
customs, that a single description will suffice for both.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>
The other native race of the district, the pygmy people
who live in the mountains, will be described in a later
chapter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FEATURES OF THE PAPUANS</div>

<p>The skin of the Mimika native is a very dark brown,
almost rusty black, but a dark colour without any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>the gloss seen in the skin of the African negro. Not
infrequently we saw men of a lighter, nearly yellow,
colour, and in the Wakatimi district there were three
pure albinos, a man, a woman and a child. The man
and woman were covered with blotches of a pinkish
pigment and were peculiarly disagreeable to look at,
the child, a sucking infant, and the offspring of black
parents, was as white as any European baby, and was
called, out of compliment to us, “Tuana.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>The hair is black and thick and frizzly; it never,
or seldom grows long, so you do not see the ornamental
coiffures characteristic of the natives of some other
parts of the island; but they are skilful in plaiting
what there is of it and take some pride in the result.
Three- or four-pronged combs are worn in the hair
more as a means of carrying a useful article than as
ornaments. The hair of young children is often quite
fair, but it becomes dark as they grow up; some of the
adults have the custom, common in other places, of
dyeing the hair yellow with lime.</p>

<p>The eye of the Papuan child is the eye of any bright
dark-eyed child here or elsewhere; the white of the
eye is white and the iris dark and clear. But very
soon the white becomes bloodshot and yellow, and the
iris blurred. The expression in the eyes is a thing
that haunts one by its forlornness and hopelessness;
it cannot be described, but you may see it in the eyes of
certain animals. They show a strong disinclination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>to look you straight in the eyes, and when you rarely
make them do so you seem to be looking into an unlighted
and empty space.</p>

<p>The teeth are strong, but not conspicuously white
and perfect like those of some other black races. A
good many men file or chip the upper incisors to a
point, but this has not, so far as we know, any particular
significance.</p>

<p>The nose is almost bridgeless and is of a somewhat
hooked and fleshy type with wide nostrils. The <i>septum</i>
of the nose is pierced when the boys are young, and the
hole is kept open by a rolled-up leaf thrust through it;
in this way it is gradually dilated until the man is able
to wear a carved ornament of a piece of the bill of a
hornbill or a curved boar’s tusk, with which he decorates
himself on festal occasions. The nose-piercing is
attended with a good deal of ceremony, but we were
never fortunate enough to see it; it is done when the
child is about five years old, and the operation is made
(according to native accounts) with a piece of sharpened
bone heated in the fire. Small ornaments are sometimes
worn in holes in the <i>alae nasi</i> which are pierced
in all the children, both boys and girls, when they are
small infants.</p>

<p>Many of the people pierce the lobes of the ear, but
the custom is not universal. The ornaments worn in
the ear are strings of two or three beads, or small rings
of plaited fibres or rattan, or the claw of a cassowary.
We took with us a large number of Jew’s harps as
trade goods, but the natives did not care for them,
and two (the only two, I believe) that we did succeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
in making the people accept, were worn by them as
ear-rings. Another man, a constant smoker, in default
of a better cigar case always carried a cigar in the lobe
of his ear.</p>

<p>Tattooing, in the proper sense of the term, is unknown
to the Mimika Papuans, but a great number of
them practise cicatrisation or scarring. The usual
places for these markings are the buttocks and the
outer side of the upper (usually the left) arm. On the
buttocks the marks are almost always the same, a cross,
about two inches square, on the left buttock, and a
cross surrounded by a circle on the right. The mark
on the arm is about four inches long and sometimes
represents a snake and sometimes a scorpion or a crayfish,
but the meaning of it, and whether or not it had
some totemistic significance we were unable to learn.
Some of the women affect a scar between the breasts,
which makes a very unsightly contraction, and we
occasionally saw people with irregular scars all over
the upper part of the breast and back, but it is probable
that most of them were the signs rather of former
quarrels than due to a spirit of coquetry.</p>

<p>They are fond of painting their faces with a bright
red earth, lumps of which they sometimes find and
prize very highly, and not infrequently we saw men with
their faces smeared black with a mixture of fat and
charcoal, or whitened with powdered sago, but the
reason, if there were any but vanity, for this adornment
we did not discover.</p>

<p>The average height of men measured at Wakatimi
and Parimau is 5 feet 6 inches. No women were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>measured, but it would probably be found that the
average height of the women was about two inches
less than that of the men. Such a height is small compared
with that of many races, but the first impression
you get of the Papuans is that they are tall, for they
hold themselves well, and all naked people look taller
than those who go clothed. Their legs are thin and
rather meagre, due in a great measure to the large proportion
of their lives that is spent in canoes, but they walk
with a good swinging gait and cover the ground easily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRESS</div>

<p>It is a curious thing that a black man never looks
naked; a white man undressed looks a naked man,
so too does a yellow man, but a Papuan—and nobody
could wear much less in the way of clothes than he
does—always seems to be sufficiently clad. The dress
of the Papuan men, as has been suggested above, is
scanty in the extreme. They have, or had before we
visited them, no cloth except a very inferior bark cloth
made from the bark of a species of fig tree. Some of
the men wear a narrow strip of this bark cloth, which
hangs down in front from a string round the loins
and keeps up an ineffectual pretence of decency.</p>

<p>The more usual covering is the bamboo penis-case,
which is kept in position by pulling the preputium
through a hole in the lower end of the case. There are
three or four different patterns of penis-cases, and they
are always ornamented with carved designs. Another
equally common fashion of covering is the shell; this
is an oval or roughly squared segment of a large white
sea shell, sometimes as much as six inches in diameter.
It is worn on a string which passes through two holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
bored in it, and is tied tightly round the loins. The
convex surface of the shell faces forwards, and the
preputium is pulled upwards and clipped under the
lower margin of the shell. Both the bamboo case and
the shell are useful as a protection against the leeches
and thorns of the jungle.</p>

<p>Small boys go quite naked until they reach the
time of puberty, when for a short period they wear a
sort of skirt made from the shredded leaves of the
<i>pandanus</i>. Though the men like very much to wear
round their heads strips of our coloured cloth, they do
not normally use any kind of head-gear except on ceremonial
occasions, when the men who beat the drums
wear elaborate hats ornamented with the plumes of
birds of paradise. Many of the men wear arm-bands
above the elbow and leg-bands below the knee, made
of tightly woven fibre or of fine strips of rattan.</p>

<p>The women are rather more clothed than the men,
but it cannot be said that they are at all overdressed.
The usual garment consists of a narrow belt of bark
cloth or grass round the waist, from which there hang
a narrow strip of bark cloth in front, reaching about
half way down the thigh, and a wider strip, somewhat
after the fashion of the tail of an Englishman’s evening
coat, extending as far as the knee behind. In addition
to this, many of the women wear a sort of short waistcoat
or sleeveless bodice made of plaited grass or fibre
with tags or tassels hanging down in a sort of fringe
from its lower edge. Newly-married women wear a
sort of apron, or rather a long fringe of shredded leaves,
which hangs down from the waist.</p>

<p class="caption">WOMEN OF WAKATIMI.<br />
(<i>On the left is a widow wearing the bonnet.</i>)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">WIDOWS’ WEEDS</div>

<p>The best dressed, or in any case the most dressed,
members of the community are the widows, who wear,
in addition to the other articles of female attire, what
can only be described as a poke bonnet. In some cases
the bonnet projects so far in front of the face as to
obscure the features, in some it is of a conical design,
and in others it resembles in shape nothing so much
as the morion of a mediaeval man-at-arms.</p>

<p>Like the waistcoats worn by the women, the bonnets
are made of ingeniously plaited fibre, and both of
these look well when they are newly made, but they
very quickly become hideous with damp and dirt, and
the wearer is a person to be shunned. The small girls,
unlike the boys, wear a narrow strip of bark cloth
tucked between the legs almost as soon as they can walk.
It is perhaps worth mentioning that these people have
the art of sewing; they make eyed needles out of
sharp fish bones, and with strands of fibre they contrive
to sew pieces of bark cloth very neatly together.</p>

<p>There are no milk-producing domesticated animals
in the country, so the women suckle their infants for
a very long time, and you may occasionally see
children of (apparently) three or four years old at their
mothers’ breasts; but whether young or old, it is very
difficult to estimate the age of these people. In the
course of a year we saw little children grow into active
boys and we saw young men become middle-aged.
I should say—but this is pure speculation—that a man
is old at forty years and a woman at an even earlier
age; it seems probable, too, that the life of a woman
is shorter than that of a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>Partly on account of the migratory habits of the
natives, and partly owing to the fact that at no hour
of the day until nightfall are all the people in or about
the houses, it was never found possible to take a census
of a village, but from our observations we arrived at
the conclusion that the number of men was decidedly
greater than that of women.</p>

<p>The number of a man’s wives was a favourite subject
for boasting and they often assured us that they had
two or even three wives, but we only knew two men
who certainly had two wives; on the other hand we
knew a considerable number of men who had no wives
at all. It appears that a man may take a wife from his
own village or from a village in the same district;
thus a Wakatimi man may take a wife from Obota
or Periepia, and a Parimau man from Kamura. There
were two women at Parimau who were said to come
from Wakatimi, but whether they had been voluntarily
exchanged or were the spoils of war we were not told.</p>

<p>It was unfortunate that we learnt nothing about
the customs and ceremonies connected with marriage.
A wedding took place at Wakatimi when we all
happened to be absent, and the only definite description
that we were able to get of it was that the bride,
who arrived from another village by canoe, crawled
on her hands and knees from the water’s edge to the
village, a distance of about a hundred yards, and most
of it through mud.</p>

<p>Beyond question, the happiest time in the lives of
the Papuans is their childhood, when they are free to
play from morning to night and need not take part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
in the ceaseless search for food, which occupies so much
of the time of their elders. As infants they are carried
on the backs of their mothers and very often of their
fathers, secured by a wide strap of bark cloth, the ends
of which are tied across the carrier’s chest. It is
very seldom that you hear them cry and they appear
to give very little trouble; their mothers are very
careful of the cleanliness of the infants. Very early
in life they begin to walk and almost as soon they learn
to swim. In fine weather they often spend the greater
part of the day in the river and it is a very pretty sight
to see a crowd of little Papuans playing together in
the water. Sometimes they are joined by the women,
who seem to enjoy the fun quite as much as the
children. One of their favourite games is to pretend
to be a school of porpoises, whose rolling headers they
imitate admirably. They very soon become powerful
swimmers, and I remember one day seeing a small boy,
who cannot have been more than eight years old, swim
across a river in tremendous flood, while the party
of men who were with him had to seek a place where
they could safely swim across half a mile lower down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GAMES OF THE CHILDREN</div>

<p>There are a number of games too that they play
on dry land: they play the universal game of lying
in wait for your enemy and suddenly pouncing out on
him; they have great battles in which they are armed
with miniature bows and arrows, and reed stems take
the place of spears, and shrill yells make up for the
lack of bloodshed. There is another game which I saw
played three or four times in exactly the same manner,
and which, by reason of it somewhat resembling a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
children’s game called “Nuts in May,” is perhaps worth
describing. Eight little boys, each one carrying a long
flowering grass, stood in two parties of four facing each
other a few yards apart. At first they waved their
grasses and then danced towards each other, crossed
and took the places that had been opposite to them;
this they repeated twice. Then they ran round and
round in a circle about five yards wide waving their
grasses and shouting until they stopped suddenly and
sat down in a bunch together. After a rest of about
half a minute, they jumped up and ran round again
in the same circle, now shouting and grabbing as they
ran handsful of sand, which they threw over their
heads into the air or between their legs into the face
of the one behind; then a sudden stop and again they
all sat down in a bunch. After this they jumped up,
ran all together for a few yards shouting loudly,
hurled all their grasses as high into the air as they
could, and the game was ended.</p>

<p>Like the children of more civilised races, the young
Papuans are fond of imitating their elders. The boys
like to be seen walking about with men, to copy their
swaggering walk, and to sit about smoking idly and
watch the women at work. The little girls sometimes
contrive to make grass garments like those worn by
the women; they make small dolls’ houses in which
they themselves, or infants still smaller than they,
are the dolls, and they like to be seen baling out the
canoes or carrying sand for the houses. But in their
case pretence is soon changed to reality, and when they
are quite young they are made to accompany their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
mothers in the serious business of life, while the boys
are still leading a gay life with no responsibilities.
Both boys and girls very early become proficient in the
management of canoes, and a child of tender years
will confidently steer a canoe through rough water
which would end in certain shipwreck for one of us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BUSINESS OF LIFE</div>

<p>The chief business in the lives of the Papuans is
that of all animals, human and others, namely, the
search for food. But while the civilised races have
learnt to foresee wants of the future, and have
established a system of agriculture which provides
food for everybody and leaves a part of the population
free to pursue other occupations, the Papuans take
no thought for the morrow, and the search for food
becomes literally a hand to mouth business, which
occupies the attentions of every member of the community.</p>

<p>They have no cultivation in the Mimika villages,
and even at those places such as Obota (see p. 88)
where there is some cultivation, the crops that they
raise are not nearly sufficient for the whole population,
so it can easily be imagined that an improvident people
living in a country constantly liable to sudden floods,
which swamp the land for weeks at a time, is frequently
faced with a prospect of complete starvation. At
first you are inclined to think that the whole of the
business of collecting food falls on the shoulders of
the women, while the men sit at home and do nothing.
This is certainly true of a great many days in the year,
but certain tasks can only be performed by the men,
such as hunting for game in the jungle, and felling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
trees to make the canoes, without which the people
must inevitably starve.</p>

<p>Their working day begins fairly early, and by about
eight o’clock the village is almost deserted by the
women, who have all gone off in canoes to fish or collect
sago. As a rule, two or three women go in each canoe,
taking with them a few children, a dog or two, several
fishing nets, rolls of matting, some spears and arrows,
a little food, a bamboo filled with fresh water, if they
are going down to the river mouth, and always a fire
burning in the stern of the boat. The usual destination
of the women is the muddy creeks among the
mangrove swamps not far from the sea; there where
the water is brackish and the tide rises and falls several
feet they find in the mud banks large mussels
(<i>Cyrena</i> sp.), which contain a good deal of food, and
the shells of which are useful as knives and scrapers.
Hopping all over the mud are seen hundreds of curious
little fish (<i>Periophthalmus</i> sp.), whose eyes seem to be
starting out of their heads; these little creatures climb
up the steepest mud banks, and even up the stumps of
trees.</p>

<img src="images/i_p120.jpg" width="400" height="515" alt="PAPUAN WOMAN AND CHILD." />
<p class="caption">PAPUAN WOMAN AND CHILD.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">FISHING</div>

<p>The commonest type of fishing net is made in an oval
framework of wood, or strips of rattan, about 5 feet long
by 2 feet wide; the net is a close mesh of native string
stretched tightly across the frame, except at the middle,
where it sags a little. The usual method of using this
kind of net is to grasp it at both ends and by wading
through the shallow water to scoop up small fish much
in the same way as shrimps are caught. There is
another more ingenious method of using it, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>sometimes results in large capture of little fish. When
the tide is high the bushes along the river bank and many
of the drooping branches of the trees are submerged;
the natives approach quietly in their canoes, cautiously
push the net under the submerged vegetation, and then
with a sudden jerk lift it up out of the water, in this way
capturing numbers of small fish which had been sheltering
or looking for food among the leaves.</p>

<p>Another form of fishing net—though there is no
netting in its construction—is made of long, thin strips
of bamboo tied parallel to each other at intervals of
about half an inch, forming a sort of screen or trellis-work,
which can be rolled up if necessary. Strong
wooden stakes are driven into the mud at the mouth
of the creeks which join the river in many places, and
at high water the screens are fastened to the stakes
in such a way as to touch the bottom and close the
entrance of the creek; the water can run back when
the tide falls, but not the fish which are sometimes
caught in considerable numbers.</p>

<p>The larger fish are all obtained by the men, who
either catch them with a hook and line, or spear them
in the shallow water near the river mouth, or along the
sea shore. We saw very few hooks; one or two were
made of rough metal, the others were neatly fashioned
from fish bones, and all of them were plain without
barbs. Now they have a large number of steel fishhooks,
which they greatly value.</p>

<p>The commonest types of fish-spear are made of
thin bamboo or a light wood about ten feet long, and
they end in three or four sharp prongs of bamboo or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
hardened wood. They also use a barbed spear of which
the head becomes detached from the shaft, when it
becomes fixed in a fish; a light line connecting the shaft
with the head causes the shaft to act as a drag on
the movements of the fish, which can easily be followed
up and killed; this kind of spear is only used for the
larger fish, saw-fish and the like, but I never saw it in
use. Considering the enormous number of fish that
there are—at the mouth of the river the water is sometimes
seen to be seething with large fish—it cannot
be said that the men are very clever with their spears.</p>

<p>They also shoot fish, using single- or three-pointed
arrows; you may see a man standing quietly in a pool
of water like a heron waiting for the fish to come up to
him, or stalking a shoal of fish stealthily from the
bank; in either case he will probably shoot arrow after
arrow without effect, for they are absurdly indifferent
marksmen with the bow.</p>

<p>The most primitive methods of all of catching fish
I saw practised one day coming down from Obota.
A native paddling in the bow of my canoe saw a large
fish near the bank, towards which he steered the canoe.
When he judged that he was near enough to it, he
hurled himself flat on to the water with a resounding
splash that drenched everything in the boat, and a
thud that would have stunned the fish at once had it
not darted off an instant earlier.</p>

<p>The sight of a fish, however small it is, always
rouses a Papuan to action. When we were travelling
with natives, we sometimes came to pools where small
fish had been left by some receding flood. Instantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
their loads were thrown down and everyone darted
into the water with sticks and stones and shouts and
as much enthusiasm as if the fish had been salmon
and a full meal for everyone.</p>

<p>There is another method of fishing which was observed
by the navigator, Captain Dampier, in use by the natives
of this region. It is so remarkable that, although we
did not see it employed by the people of the Mimika
district, I shall make no excuse for repeating it here:—</p>

<p>“They strike Fish very ingeniously with Wooden
Fiss-gigs and have a very ingenious way of making
the Fish rise: For they have a piece of Wood curiously
carv’d and painted much like a Dolphin (and perhaps
other Figures;) these they let down into the Water
by a Line with a small weight to sink it; when they
think it low enough, they haul the Line into their
Boats very fast, and the Fish rise up after this Figure;
and they stand ready to strike them when they are
near the Surface of the Water.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>There are times when the natives get more fish
than they know what to do with, and other times when
no fish can be caught; but they have no idea of laying
up a store for the lean times. It is true that they char
some in the fire and keep them for a few days before
the fish putrify, but if they learnt to smoke some of their
surplus supply, they need never go hungry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOOD OF THE NATIVES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> search for food furnishes occasionally some very
curious scenes. One of the most remarkable occurs when
the river in flood brings down a tree-trunk in a suitable
stage of decay. A canoe is sent out with men to secure
it and tow it to the bank. When it has been left stranded
by the falling water, the people, men, women and children
come out and swarm around it like bees about a honey-pot,
and you wonder what they can be doing. When you go
close you find that some are splitting up the log with their
stone axes and others are cutting up the fragments with
sharpened shells in the same way that their ancestors—and
perhaps ours too—did centuries ago. The objects of
their search are the large white <i>larvæ</i> of a beetle, about
the size of a man’s thumb; I have seen natives eat them
just as they cut them out of the wood, but usually they
roast them in the fire and consider them a great delicacy.</p>

<p>Nothing that can by any means be considered eatable
comes amiss to the Papuans; there are two kinds of
water tortoises which they like to eat, and rats, lizards,
frogs and snakes, and the eggs of crocodiles they devour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
greedily. A number of different kinds of fruits, most of
them disagreeable to European tastes, are found growing
in the jungle and form a welcome addition to their fare.
Birds they get occasionally, but their skill with the bow
and arrow is not remarkable.</p>

<p>Most of their meat is obtained by hunting with dogs
the wild pig, the wallaby and the cassowary. The pig
(<i>Sus papuensis</i>), though it is not really a native of New
Guinea, was introduced into the island so long ago that
it has become as well established as the rabbit has become
in this country. In some places, particularly near the
foot of the mountains, pigs are fairly numerous, and the
natives kill a good many; they are very savage beasts,
and I saw a native terribly gashed by a large boar, which
was shortly afterwards shot by one of our Gurkhas.</p>

<p>The Wallaby (<i>Dorcopsis lorentzii</i>) is a small kangaroo,
about two feet in height when it stands upright; it seems
to be fairly evenly distributed all over the district. When
the natives bestir themselves they seem to be able to catch
the wallaby fairly easily; in four consecutive days we
saw the remains of thirteen brought into the village of
Parimau. The flesh is coarse and has a very strong musky
flavour.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of Cassowary in the Mimika district,
a small species new to science (<i>Casuarius claudi</i>),
which was discovered in the mountains at an altitude of
about 1500 feet, and a large species (<i>Casuarius sclateri</i>),
which was fairly abundant everywhere. We frequently
heard their curious booming cry at night and we often saw
their tracks in the mud of the jungle or on the river bank,
but they are very shy birds and are seldom seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Once I had the luck to see an old cassowary with
two young birds walking about in a stony river bed,
a place which they particularly affect, and it was a very
pretty sight to see how the mother bird, after she had
caught sight of me, drove away the chicks to a place
of safety and all the time kept herself between them
and me. The natives hunt and kill and eat a good
many cassowaries; the feathers are used for ornamental
head-dresses and belts and for decorating spears and
clubs, and the claws are often used as the points of
arrows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NATIVE DOGS</div>

<p>The Papuan Dog, without whose help the native
would seldom, if ever, be able to get any meat, is a
sharp-nosed prick-eared creature about the size of a
Welsh terrier. The colour is yellow, brown or black,
and the tail, which is upstanding, is tipped with white.
Usually the hair is short and smooth, but we saw one
dog, brought down to Parimau by a party of pygmies,
which had a thick furry coat like a chow dog, which it
also resembled in the carriage of its tail. The dogs
in the village of the pygmies which we visited, were
smooth-coated like those of the Papuans, so it is
possible that that thick-coated animal came from some
remote district where the natives live at a higher altitude.</p>

<p>The Papuan dogs are very sociable creatures, and
they like to accompany the natives on their journeys.
They are particularly fond of going in canoes on the
river, and two or three are seen in nearly every canoe
even when the people are only out fishing. Their
food is generally given to them by the women and it
consists of raw meat, when there is any, and lumps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of sago. A remarkable peculiarity about them is that
they never bark, but they make up for this defect by
their extraordinary power of howling. Sometimes in
broad daylight, if there was no wind, but more often
on still fine nights, a party of dogs would sit together,
usually on the river bank, and utter a chorus of the
most piteous and blood-curdling howls. No amount
of stone-throwing or beating with sticks, freely administered
by their masters, had the smallest effect on them;
they would only move away a few yards and begin
again, apparently carried away by an ecstasy of sorrow.</p>

<p>The natives value their dogs highly, as they well
may do, for they provide the whole of their meat supply,
and they use them to exchange for articles of which
they have great need. The people at Parimau have a
small piece of iron about the size of a chisel, used
for carving their canoes and paddles, for which the
enormous price of three dogs had been paid, so they
informed us, to the people of the Wakatimi. One
day one of our “boys” shot a dog, which had been
in the habit of stealing food from our camp. When
the natives knew that it was dead, all the people of the
village began to wail in the same manner as they do
when a person dies, and the owner of the dog smeared
himself with mud and mourned bitterly. No doubt
the display was somewhat exaggerated in the hope of
getting a compensation from us, but at the back of it
there was genuine emotion.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the food of the
Papuans and their means of obtaining it, a word must
be said on the question of cannibalism. It is popularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
supposed that all the natives of New Guinea are
cannibals, and fears were expressed by many of our
friends that some, if not all, of us would end in a Papuan
feast. But we saw no signs of cannibalism, and we
have no reason to suppose that it is practised by the
people of the Mimika district. Men whom we questioned
about it denied it and showed expressions of disgust
at the suggestion; but that is not a complete proof
of their innocence, for I have known people elsewhere,
who were undoubtedly cannibals, deny it in the same
manner. The question of cannibalism is always difficult
to decide without direct evidence, and in the case
of these Papuans the verdict must be one of “Not
proven.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIAL SYSTEM OF THE PAPUANS</div>

<p>The account given in a preceding chapter of the
difficulties we experienced in learning the language of
the Papuans will serve to explain how it was that we
learnt so little about the nature of their social system.
The people of Wakatimi were called <i>Wakatimi-wé</i>
(people of Wakatimi), the people of Obota were
<i>Obota-wé</i>, and the people of other villages in like manner,
but we never heard one word that included them all,
nor indeed do we know whether or not they consider
themselves all to belong to the same tribe.</p>

<p>In every village that we visited there were one or
two or even more men who called themselves <i>natoo</i>,
a word signifying “chief.” But in no case did the
<i>natoo</i> appear to have any authority over the other
people; their houses were no bigger than the rest, and
(except in one instance) they had no more personal
property than the other members of the community.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p128.jpg" width="400" height="647" alt="A PAPUAN OF MIMIKA." />
<p class="caption">A PAPUAN OF MIMIKA.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>The exceptional case was a man of unusual intelligence
who became our intimate friend and gave us much
information for which he was always well rewarded,
so that before we left the country his house was filled
with tins and bottles, and he was the possessor of axes
and knives, yards of cloth and countless beads. In all
the ordinary affairs of life the “chiefs” and their
families have to work like everybody else, but it is
possible that in their wars, of which we saw nothing
at all, they may be persons of more consequence.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, one would say that the society
of the Mimika Papuans is a group of small families. It
cannot by any means be described as a socialistic community;
with one exception there is no sign of community
of property, but it is rather a case of every man
for himself, or (more accurately) of every family for
itself. A canoe belongs to the family of the man who
made it; the coconut trees, which grow here and there
along the lower Mimika, do not belong to the community
but to individuals, presumably the men or
some of the men who planted them. Sometimes the
trees are protected by a fence, a very flimsy structure
of three or four sticks, placed across the track which
leads to the trees; in other cases a few palm leaves or
some pierced shells threaded on a string are tied round
the tree itself; both of these devices appear to be
enough to ensure the security of the trees. The exception
mentioned is seen when game is brought in by
the hunters; the meat, as I observed on several
occasions, is distributed to every house in the village.</p>

<p>As I have described above (p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>) the houses in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
village are joined together under a common roof, but
each family enters by its own doorway, and, except
for the publicity resulting from the lack of dividing
walls or partitions, it finds itself in its own private
house. It is difficult to say exactly of what the
“family-group” consists. There are the man and his
wife and the children, and sometimes an extra man or
two, and, rarely, an extra woman, who is, I believe,
always a second wife of the man of the house; but the
position of the extra men and their relationship to
the rest of the family I cannot define. At the village
of Obota a detached house, rather larger than the rest,
was said to be occupied by young men only; we did
not see any other instance of this elsewhere.</p>

<p>Families are small, as might be expected from the
severity of their conditions of life and the long period
of suckling by the mothers, and we did not know
definitely of any couple who had more than three living
children. Though the women do a large amount of
the work of the community they are not mere drudges;
they do a great deal of talking, and the men appear
to pay considerable respect to their opinion. This
was frequently noticeable when we wanted to buy
something, such as canoes, from a native; he would
say that he must first of all go and consult his wife,
and when he returned it often happened that, prompted
by his wife, he insisted on a higher payment than he
had asked before.</p>

<p>On one occasion only did we see a woman ill-treated,
and the performance was a particularly brutal one.
Two men and a woman walked down from the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of Wakatimi to the river bank, dragging another woman,
who shrieked and struggled violently. After throwing
her into the mud they dragged her into the shallow
water and tried to drown her by holding her down under
a fishing-net. We shouted at them, and were just going
with some soldiers in a canoe across the river to rescue
the woman, when they desisted and allowed the poor
creature to crawl out on to the bank, where she lay for
some time exhausted. Some natives who came over to
us shortly afterwards laughed about it and treated the
whole affair as a joke.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPUAN SUPERSTITIONS</div>

<p>With regard to the superstitions and beliefs of the
Papuans, owing to our unfortunate difficulties with the
language we learnt nothing whatever. Religion, in
the accepted sense of that term, I am sure they have
not. It is true that they make curious carved effigies,
but these are not idols, and there is no evidence to show
that they ever consult or worship them; on the contrary,
they treat them with contempt and often
point to them with laughter. These images are ingeniously
and skilfully carved out of wood, and they
represent a human figure always grotesque and sometimes
grossly indecent. They vary in size from a few
inches to twelve or fourteen feet, and when they are not
neglected they are ornamented with red and white
paint.</p>

<p>We had opportunities of observing the outward
signs of what were probably superstitions in connection
with certain phenomena of the weather. For instance,
the first peal of thunder that was heard in the day—it
occurred almost every day—was greeted by the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
with a long-drawn tremulous shout. On the occasion
of a particularly alarming thunderstorm, when the
lightning flashes were almost unceasing, the men came
out of doors and with long sticks beat the ground in
front of their huts; then they waved the sticks in the
air, shouting loudly meanwhile. Curiously enough the
rare whistle of a certain bird, which we never identified,
was always greeted by the men of Parimau with a shout
precisely similar to that with which they greet the
thunder.</p>

<p>The first sight of the new moon was signalised by a
short sharp bark rather than a shout. Several times
on the day following the first sight of the new moon
I noticed a spear decorated with white feathers exposed
conspicuously in the village, but whether it had any
connection with the kalendar I cannot say.</p>

<p>When the first drops of rain of the day began to
fall, the men were sometimes seen to snap their fingers
four times towards the four quarters of the compass.</p>

<p>A curious ceremony was twice observed at a time
of heavy rain, when the Mimika was rising rapidly and
threatening to sweep away the village of Parimau. A
party of men walked down to the edge of the river,
and one of them with a long spear threshed the water,
while the others at each stroke shouted, “<i>Mbu</i>” (water,
flood). Then they went up to the village, and in front
of each door they dug a hole, into which they poured
a coconut-full of water; again they shouted “<i>Mbu</i>,”
and then filled up the hole with sand.</p>

<p>That they have some belief in the supernatural is
certain. We learnt a word <i>niniki</i>, which undoubtedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
means ghosts; they described <i>niniki</i> as things which
you could not see but were here and there in the air
about you. When they were asked where a dead man
had gone to, they talked of <i>niniki</i>, and pointed vaguely
to the horizon, saying the word which means “far.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">PIGS</div>

<p>If there is one thing in heaven or earth to which it
may be said that the Papuans pay some sort of respect
it is the pig. They hunt and kill a good many wild
pigs in the jungle and eat their flesh, but the lower
jaw of each animal is carefully cleaned and hung up
on a sort of rack in front of the houses; on one of
these racks I counted no fewer than thirty-two pigs’
jaws. The grass and leaves in which the animal is
wrapped and the ropes used for tying it up when it is
carried home from the jungle, are not thrown away
but are hung up on a similar sort of rack in a conspicuous
place in the village.</p>

<p>In every village there may generally be seen two
or three pigs running about freely; they are probably
not bred in the village, but are caught in the jungle,
when they are young. They very soon become quite
tame and accompany the people on their migrations
from one place to another until they are full grown,
when they provide food for a festival. The only
elaborate popular ceremony that took place while we
were in the country happened early in May at Parimau,
and the principal feature of it was the slaughter of pigs.
Unfortunately for me I was at the base-camp at the
time and did not see the festival, so I will make extracts
from Marshall’s graphic account.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A VILLAGE FESTIVAL</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>
<p>“Yesterday the natives gave us an excellent show.
For some days previously natives had been arriving
from distant parts until the small village of 40 huts
contained 400 people, and it was evident from the
tomtomming and other signs that something of importance
was about to take place. On the night of
the 3rd inst. they lit a big bonfire, and all night long
they were howling and yelling as if to drive away evil
spirits. Soon after daybreak they came over to fetch
us, and, expecting something unusual, I slipped a film
into my cinematograph camera and went over. They
gave me every opportunity of obtaining a good
picture, keeping an open space for me in the best
positions. First of all the women, draped in leaves,
slowly walked down the beach, driving two full-grown
boars in front of them, and then disappeared
in the jungle. About 150 men with faces painted
and heads and spears decorated with feathers, formed
up in three sides of a square, one end of which was
occupied by a band of tomtoms. A slow advance
on the village then commenced, the men shouting
in chorus and the women dancing on the outskirts.
The centre of the square was occupied by single
individuals, who, following each other in quick
succession, gave a warlike display, finally shooting
arrows far over the trees.</p>

<p class="caption">A TYPICAL PAPUAN OF MIMIKA.</p></div>

<p>“The next scene took place around a large sloping
erection which we soon found was an altar, on which
the two boars were about to be sacrificed. The
women and boars who had disappeared into the
forest now marched from the jungle at the far end of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>the village. The boars were seized, and a struggle
with the animals ensued, but the two huge brutes
were bound up with rattan, chalk meanwhile being
rubbed into their eyes, apparently in order to blind
them. The women set up a tremendous wailing,
and appeared on the scene plastered in wet mud from
head to foot. The two boars, on each of which a man
sat astride, were now hoisted up and carried to the
altar, on which the animals were tightly lashed. Then
amid much shouting, tomtomming, and fanatical
displays, the boars were clubbed to death. As soon
as life was extinct, the women cut the carcases free,
and, pulling them to the ground, threw themselves
on the dead bodies, wailing loudly, and plastering
themselves with wet mud in ecstasies of grief. This
continued for some ten minutes, when the men, many
of whom were covered with mud and uttered strange
dirges, picked up the bodies, and the whole assembly
following suit marched into the river, where a much-needed
washing took place. Just previous to this
a three-year-old child, painted red and crying loudly,
had been roughly seized and dragged towards the
dais, and for a moment we thought something more
serious than a boar sacrifice was about to take place.
But we were much relieved to see that it was only
having its ears pierced. The whole performance
lasted about an hour and a half.</p>

<p>“The afternoon was given over to innocent play,
the women and girls—many of them quite pretty—chasing
the men up to the river side and into the
water. This is one of the few ceremonies when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
women are allowed to beat the men, the latter not
being permitted to retaliate. The damsels finally
became so bold that they stormed the camp.”</p>

<p>Of ceremonies connected with birth, if any take
place, we saw nothing at all. The only marriage
ceremony that took place during our stay in the country
has been referred to on a preceding page.</p>

<p>Deaths were unfortunately more frequent, and if
they were not accompanied by any elaborate ceremonial
they were, at all events, widely advertised, sometimes
indeed even before the event itself. A wretched man
became very ill at Parimau in August, and it was soon
evident that his days were numbered. Members of
his family carried him out of the house and laid him in
the sunlight for a time, and then took him back into the
house again at least half a dozen times a day. Now
and again, when he dozed, they set up the dreadful
wail that is customary when a person dies, and he had
to wake up and assure them of his continued life. At
night his hut was crowded with sympathetic watchers,
and with the smoke of the fire and much tobacco the
atmosphere must have been nearly insupportable. As
our own house was distant only about forty yards across
the river we could plainly hear his laboured breathing,
and when it grew softer they wailed again until the
wonder was that he did not die. On the third day
they dug a grave for him, but still he lingered on, and
it was not until the fifth night, when a tremendous
flood came down and swept away the village so that
all the people had to take refuge in their canoes, that he
died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">WAILING AT DEATH</div>

<p>When a death occurs the people in the hut at once
begin to wail, then the people in the neighbouring huts
join in and soon the whole village is wailing. It is a
very peculiar and very striking chorus. Each individual
wails on one note, and as there are perhaps five
notes ranging from a very high pitch to a deep
murmured bass being sung at once, the effect is most
mournful. The occasional beat of a drum adds not a
little to the general effect of lamentation. It must
be admitted, however, that the wailing is not always
a musical performance. Sometimes the mourning man
behaves in the way that a child does when it is described
as “roaring”; he puckers up his face in the most
extraordinary contortions, “roars” at the top of his
voice with occasional heart-breaking sobs, while the
tears course down his face, and the complete picture
is ludicrous in the extreme.</p>

<p>The disposal of the dead nearly always takes place
just before dawn, but the method of it is not always
the same. The most common practice is to bury the
body in a shallow grave dug in the nearest convenient
spot, sometimes within a few yards of the huts. The
body is wrapped in mats and laid flat in the grave,
which is then filled up, and its place is perhaps marked
by a stick, but in a day or two it is forgotten and people
trample on it without heed.</p>

<p>We observed one instance of a more elaborate kind
of burial. The corpse, wrapped in leaves and mats,
was taken out into the jungle and placed on a platform
about four feet high, which had been put up for the
purpose. After placing the body on the platform the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
men who had carried it walked down to the river, shouted
once in unison, and then, having received an answering
shout from the men in the village, one of them threw
a small triangular piece of wood out into the stream.
In the meantime the family of the dead man disappeared
into the jungle, from which they soon emerged
quite naked, plastered all over with mud and decorated
with wisps of climbing plants. The next two days
were spent in digging a grave and making a coffin
shaped like a small canoe; this however was found
to be too small and was not used. On the third day
the body was placed in the grave, and an ornamental
post placed in the ground at each end, but contrary
to our hopes (for the state of that man was becoming
very offensive) they did not fill in the grave. They
merely covered the body with leaves and turned it
over every day. At intervals the widow, quite naked,
save for a plastering of mud, crawled on hands and knees
from her hut, which was less than five yards distant,
and visited the grave. In a few days a providential
flood came and filled up the grave and put an end to what
had become for us an almost intolerable nuisance.</p>

<p>Both at Wakatimi and at Parimau our camp commanded
a good view of the native village, and a death
always provided us with the mild excitement of wondering
in what new way they would celebrate the event.
On one occasion when a woman died, the bereaved
husband and another man walked slowly down to the river
and waded out into about three feet of water. There
the widower submitted to being washed all over by
the other man and finally to being held under water by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
him for half a minute or more, after which they walked
solemnly back to the village.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD</div>

<p>Early in the morning of the day after the death of
the <i>natoo</i> of Wakatimi all the women and girls of the
village, to the number of sixty or seventy, came down
to the river, all of them without a vestige of clothing,
and in the shallow water a foot or two deep they swam
and crawled and wriggled up the river for a hundred
yards or more, wailing loudly all the time. Sometimes
they came out on to the bank and rolled in the mud,
and finally they all went out of the water and stood
wailing in front of the dead man’s house.</p>

<p>Another method of disposing of the dead, which is
very frequently adopted, is to place the body wrapped
in mats in a rude coffin, which is usually constructed
from pieces of broken canoes. The coffin containing
the body is supported on a trestle of crossed sticks about
four feet from the ground (see illustration opposite),
and there it remains until decomposition is complete.
As these coffins are often placed within a yard or two
of the houses, it can be imagined that a Papuan village
is not always a pleasant place to visit.</p>

<p>At the village of Nimé we saw two or three pathetic
little bundles containing the remains of infants exposed
on racks within a few feet of the houses, from which
they doubtless came.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p139.jpg" width="400" height="560" alt="DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD. A COFFIN ON TRESTLES." />
<p class="caption">DISPOSAL OF THE DEAD. A COFFIN ON TRESTLES.</p></div>

<p>When decomposition is complete no account is taken
of the bones, excepting the skull, which is taken and
preserved in the house. Sometimes it is buried in the
sand of the floor of the house, and sometimes it is tied
up in a sort of open basket-work of rattan and hung
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>up in the roof, where it becomes brown with smoke and
polished by frequent handling.</p>

<p>Though the people take the trouble to bring the
skulls into their houses, they show no real respect for
them, and they are eager enough to part with them if a
chance occurs. Two of us went one day to Obota, a
village a few miles from Wakatimi, in the hopes of
buying some bananas. In one of the huts we saw a skull
and offered to buy it, not at all expecting that the owner
would be willing to sell, but the offer of (I think) a piece
of cloth was gladly accepted and the skull was ours.
In a few minutes, when it became known that we had
given good cloth for a common skull, everybody was
anxious to sell his family remains, and outside every
doorway were placed one or two or even three grinning
skulls. They do not treat the skulls very carefully,
and a good many were damaged, so we only bought
about half a dozen that were perfect.</p>

<p>One day a man walked into our camp at Wakatimi
carrying a skull under his arm. He stood outside our
house for some time, grinning and saying nothing, then
he gave us unmistakably to understand that it was
the skull of his wife, who, as we knew for a fact, had only
died a short time previously. The skull was indeed
so fresh that we declined the offer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most pleasing characteristic of the Papuans is their
love of music. When a number of them are gathered
together and when they have eaten well, or are for any
other reason happy, they have a concert. Sometimes
the concerts take place in the afternoon and continue
till nightfall, but more often they begin after dark and
go on almost through the night. The orchestra is simple
and consists of two or three men who beat drums and
sit before a small fire in the middle. Round them are
grouped the chorus all sitting on the ground. The
drums are hollowed cylinders of wood, which are often
elaborately carved; one end is open, the other is closed
by a piece of lizard’s or snake’s skin (see illustration p.
142). When this skin becomes slack, as it very quickly
does, the drummer holds it towards the fire until it
regains its pitch. It is not the custom to tune up both
drums, when there are more than one, to the same pitch,
usually an interval of about half a tone is left between
them. The leader of the orchestra sometimes wears a
remarkable head-dress made of plaited fibre and ornamented
with bunches of plumes of the Bird of Paradise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
(see illustration p. 78). The effect of these plumes waving
backwards and forwards as the man moves his head
to mark the phrases of the song is exceedingly striking,
and it must be admitted that if there is anybody, who
can becomingly wear those gorgeous plumes, it is the
naked black man.</p>

<p>The most usual kind of song begins with a slow tapping
of the drums, then these are beaten quicker and
the singer (one of the drummers) begins a sort of recitative
song, to which the chorus contributes a low humming
accompaniment. Then the drums are beaten very
loudly and rapidly, all the men in chorus sing, or rather
growl, a deep guttural note, followed by a prolonged
musical note at about the middle of the register of a
normal man’s voice, and the song ends with one or more
short sharp barks, “Wah! wah! wah!” with a loud
drum accompaniment. The song, or probably different
verses of it, is repeated very many times. The final
shouts of the song, which for want of a better word I
have called “barks,” are uttered by all the men in
unison and recall, as was pointed out by Mr. Goodfellow,
the harsh croaking call of the Greater Bird of Paradise,
which is heard almost daily in the jungle. It is possible
that the song is in some way connected with the bird
and that there is an intentional imitation of its note.</p>

<p>The scheme of all these songs is the same, viz., a recitative
with drums and a humming accompaniment, but
some of them have really rollicking choruses, and we
used to listen to them at night with extreme pleasure as
they came, somewhat softened by distance, over the
water to our camp at Wakatimi. The voices of the men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>are often rich, and they have a true musical ear. Their
intervals are very similar to ours and not at all like
those of the Malays and many other Eastern singers,
who recognize perhaps five notes where we have only
two. Beside the drum the only instrument of music they
have is a straight trumpet made from a short piece of
bamboo. This produces only a single booming note and
is not used at the concerts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DANCING HOUSE</div>

<p>As an amusement of the Papuans even more important
than singing is dancing, of which they often talked,
but though we saw some of their dancing halls (see
illustration p. 48), we never had the good fortune to
witness a performance. At the coast village of Nimé, a
few miles to the East of the Mimika River, there was a
very elaborate dancing house, which must have cost an
immense amount of labour to build. The length of the
house from front to back was about 100 feet, the width
about 25 feet, and it rested on poles which were about
8 feet high in front, rising up to about 14 feet high at
the back. The side walls and the back were of “atap”
as was also the roof, which sloped from a long ridgepole
running the whole length of the house. The ridgepole
was remarkable as being made from a single tree
trunk (<i>Casuarina</i>) shaved down very smoothly to a uniform
thickness of about 10 inches; the ends of it, which
projected about 8 feet both at the front and back of
the house, were carved in very lifelike representations
of the head of a crocodile and were painted red. The
weight of the beam must have been immense and one
wondered how it had been hoisted into position. Between
the ridge of the roof and the eaves there projected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
both in front and at the back six other smaller poles
grotesquely carved to represent fish and reptiles and
hideous human heads. The front of the house was open,
and when you had climbed up the supporting poles and
had stepped over a low fence you found yourself in a
spacious hall with a floor well made of sheets of bark,
which sloped up gradually from front to back. Along
either side at regular intervals on the floor were sand
fireplaces and above these were wooden racks, from
which it was evident that something was hung to be
cooked. Round the walls on all sides was a strip of
carved and painted wood, and exactly in the middle
of the hall, fixed to the floor and the roof were two
posts about 3 feet apart and tied between them, at
about half the height of a man, was an elaborately
carved and painted board about twelve inches wide.
In the middle of this board was carved the eye, which
is a familiar feature of the ornamental carving on the
canoes and drums, and it appeared that this eye is the
centre of the ceremonies which take place in the house.</p>

<p>So far as I could understand from the description of
the natives who accompanied me in my visit to the
house, the people, both men and women, who take
part in the ceremony, dance slowly upwards from the
front of the house singing as they go, and when they
reach the carved board each one in turn touches the
eye, while all the people shout together. But what the
object of the whole performance is and what the people
cook and eat, are questions to which I was unable to
find an answer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PAPUAN ARTISTS</div>

<p>I have had occasion above to mention the artistic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>carvings on the canoes and drums. Their paddles too
show a very good idea of design, as will be seen from
the illustration p. 144. Nothing amused them more
than to be provided with a pencil and pieces of paper
and to attempt to draw figures. Their efforts were not
always very successful, and some of the drawings which
I have kept would be quite unrecognisable for what
they are, if I had not labelled them at the time. Like
the young of civilised races they always preferred to
draw the figures of men and women, and some of these
are remarkable for having the mouth near the top of
the head above the level of the eyes. The method of
drawing is very simple; the pencil is held almost upright
on the paper and the outline of the figure, begun at
an arm or leg or anywhere indifferently, is drawn in
one continuous stroke without removing the pencil
from the paper. The end is always rather exciting,
like the feat of drawing a pig when you are blindfolded,
for the artist is never quite certain of finishing at the
point whence he started. Besides human figures they
liked drawing dogs, pigs, birds and fishes. Two pictures
of a dog and a bird both done by the same man are
peculiarly interesting, because they were both drawn
upside down. I watched the man making the drawings,
and when they were finished I saw that the legs of the
creatures were uppermost; so I turned the papers the
right way round and handed them back to him, but
he inverted them again and admired them in that position.
Curiously enough the same man drew human figures in
the correct attitude, head uppermost, so that the state
of his mental vision offers rather a puzzling problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>Most of them had a keen appreciation of pictures
and they were surprisingly quick in identifying photographs
of themselves; in this respect they showed a
good deal more intelligence than some of our Gurkhas,
who held a photograph sideways or upside down and
gazed at it blankly, as if they had not the faintest
idea of what it portrayed. The illustrated papers were
a source of endless delight to them, and the portraits
of beautiful ladies, who they felt sure were our wives,
were greatly admired. Horses, sheep, cattle and all
other animals were declared to be dogs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CAT’S CRADLE</div>

<p>Another amusement—it can hardly be called an art—of
the Papuans is the game of cat’s cradle, at which
many of them are extraordinarily proficient. It is not,
as with us, a game played by two persons; with them
the part of the second person is performed by the
player’s teeth, and he contrives to produce some wonderfully
intricate figures, none of which, I regret to say,
we had patience or skill enough to learn. The most
elaborate figure I saw was supposed to represent a bird,
and when the features of it had been pointed out some
resemblance was certainly apparent.</p>

<p>But it must be admitted that their amusements
are not always so innocent as drawing pictures and
playing cat’s cradle. I have referred above to the
gang of drunkards, who used to create such turmoil at
Wakatimi. The people of Parimau, who had no means
of getting intoxicated, were just as quarrelsome as the
Wakatimi people, and fights were of frequent, almost
daily occurrence. Some one does something, it matters
not what, to offend some other person, and in an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
the village is in an uproar. Spears fly through the air—we
never saw anybody touched by one—and stone clubs
are brandished furiously, the combatants all shout horrible
threats at the tops of their voices, while a few people
look on stolidly or hardly take any notice at all. There
seems to be a certain etiquette about the use of clubs,
for the person about to be hit generally presents a soft
part of his person, the back or shoulders, to the clubber,
and we never saw a man intentionally hit another on
the head, a blow which might easily be fatal; but blood
flowed in plenty from the flesh wounds.</p>

<p>The part of the women in these village squabbles is
always to scream loudly and generally to begin by banging
the houses with sticks or spears and to end with
pulling them to pieces. In a fight at Wakatimi we saw
a party of infuriated women absolutely demolish three or
four houses. The fights end almost as suddenly as they
begin and in a short time the village settles down to its
usual tranquillity. Neither the sight nor the sound of
these village quarrels is very agreeable, but they have no
regularly organised games and, at the worst, not a very
great amount of damage is done.</p>

<p>The clubs used in these village fights and doubtless
also in their tribal wars—but of those we know nothing—are
of two kinds, wooden and stone-headed. The wooden
clubs are about four feet long and consist of a plain shaft,
of which the last foot or rather more is carved into a
saw-like cutting edge; some of these are made of a
very heavy wood and they are exceedingly formidable
weapons. A more simple type of wooden club is a plain
wooden shaft rather thinner at the handle end than at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>the other, round which is fixed a piece of shark’s skin or
the prickly skin from the back of the Sting Ray and
often with it is tied the saw of a small Saw fish; such
a club appears to be capable of inflicting a very nasty
wound.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p148.jpg" width="400" height="591" alt="SPLITTING WOOD WITH A STONE AXE." />
<p class="caption">SPLITTING WOOD WITH A STONE AXE.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">STONE CLUBS</div>

<p>There is a great variety of stone-headed clubs, but
they are all alike in being furnished with a wooden shaft,
which is usually a plain piece of wood, but occasionally
carved near the club end. The stone head is pierced in
the middle by a round hole about an inch in diameter,
through which the shaft is passed and fixed firmly by
wedges. Most of the heads are made of a rather soft
limestone, but where the people obtain it we do not
know, for there is no stone of any kind near the coast.
The simplest type is merely a round water-worn pebble
with a hole bored through it. More commonly they are
worked and the labour of producing them must have
been considerable. Some are flat discs with sharp cutting
edges or blunt and roughly milled edges, and some are
cut into the form of five or six or more pointed stars;
rarely they are triangular. Others again are round or
oval and are cut into more or less deep teeth, or they
have small bosses left projecting here and there, but no
two of them are exactly alike. The weight of the club
head is usually two or three pounds. The most savage-looking
club we saw was simply a rough lump of coral,
not trimmed in any way. It was pierced and mounted
on a finely carved shaft of extremely heavy wood, and
the whole thing must have weighed fifteen or twenty
pounds.</p>

<p>Not a little credit is due to the Papuans for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
industry in making these elaborate weapons, for it must
be remembered that until we visited the country they had
no metal tools whatever, with the exception of two or
three scraps of soft iron, and all their work was done
with shell knives and stone axes. The knives are simply
the shells of a common freshwater bivalve (<i>Cyrena</i> sp.);
when these are rubbed down on a stone, they take on an
exceedingly sharp edge and are used by the natives for
carving the canoes and drums and sharpening their spears
and arrows.</p>

<p>The stone axes used in the Mimika district are all of
the same type, though they vary greatly in size from
about four inches to large ones of nearly twelve inches in
length. The stone of which they are made is always the
same, a quartzite. The shaft is about two feet long and
is invariably made of the butt end of a bamboo. A hole
is bored and burnt in the lower end of the bamboo, that
is to say in the solid part of the wood below the first
joint, and the pointed end of the stone is jammed into
the hole. The stone is always fixed axe-fashion, <i>i.e.</i> with
its broad surface and cutting edge in the same plane with
the long axis of the handle, and not adze-fashion, as is
the custom in some other parts of New Guinea (see
illustration p. 142). The axes quickly become blunt
with use and they are sharpened by being rubbed upon
another stone. At Wakatimi stones are very rare and
one man appeared to be the stone-smith of the village.
I remember seeing him one day sitting outside his hut
sharpening an axe, with three or four others lying beside
him waiting to be done, while a few yards away a woman
was splitting a log of wood with a stone axe. It struck
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>me as being one of the most primitive scenes I had ever
witnessed, really a glimpse of the Stone Age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOWS AND ARROWS</div>

<p>The bows of the Mimika natives are about five feet
long and are made of a simple straight piece of a very hard
wood (usually a species of <i>pandanus</i>), tapering towards
the ends, which are sometimes ornamented with the claw
of a cassowary or a tuft of feathers and shells or the
claw of a crab. The “string” is a piece of rattan and it
requires a strong arm to bend the bow. The arrows are
of various types (see illustration p. 150); they are all
made of reed stems, and none are ever feathered nor have
they nocks. They vary only in their points, which are
sometimes merely the sharpened end of the reeds themselves
and sometimes a plain sharpened tip of hard wood
or bamboo. Some are tipped with the sharpened claw of
a cassowary or with the spine that lies along the back
of the Sting Ray, and the arrows used for shooting fish
have often three points of sharp bamboo.</p>

<p>Most people have the idea that the savage man
performs prodigies of skill with his bow and arrows, but
whenever I saw the Papuans shooting, they made
astonishingly bad practice. I remember seeing two
Papuans trying to kill an iguana in a tree not more than
twenty feet above the ground; they shot arrow after
arrow at it, but the creature, which was as long and
almost as thick as a man’s arm, climbed slowly up from
branch to branch until it was lost to view.</p>

<p>The hunting spears are of two kinds, a plain straight
shaft of heavy wood, very sharp and hardened by fire at
the tip; and a straight shaft of a lighter wood, to the end
of which is fixed part of a straight bone (generally the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
<i>tibia</i>) of a pig, sharpened to a fine point. There is
another kind of spear made of a soft wood, finely pointed
and with a wide blade carved in a sort of open-work
fashion (see illustration p. 150); the blade and the point
are painted red with clay and the shaft is generally
decorated with feathers or plaited fibre. Spears of this
sort are of no use in hunting but are employed at dances
and other ceremonial functions.</p>

<p>Two more pieces of furniture, the head-rest and the
sago bowl, complete the list of articles made by the
Papuans. The head-rests, which were seen only in the
villages of Obota and Nimé, are made of a strip of
elaborately carved wood four or five inches wide and
between two and three feet in length, and are supported
at each end by a stout wooden prop, which raises the
head-rest about four inches above the ground. The
longer head-rests are supposed to support the heads of
two sleeping persons.</p>

<p>Fire is nearly always taken by the Papuans wherever
they go; in almost every canoe a fire is kept burning,
and when they travel through the jungle the men
carry a smouldering stick. There must be occasions
when all these fires are extinguished, but how they produce
them we were unable to learn; the Papuans of
Parimau could not make fire with the friction stick and
rattan used by their neighbours, the Tapiro Pygmies.</p>

<p>From the description of them which has been given in
this and the two preceding chapters it will be seen that
the conditions of life of the Papuans are as primitive as
those of any people now living in the world. There are
very few other places, where you can find a people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
neither make nor possess any metal and who have no
knowledge of pottery. The only vessels that they have
for holding water are scraped-out coconuts and simple
pieces of bamboo. Water boiling they had never seen
before we came among them. Their implements and
weapons are, as I have shown, of the most primitive
kind, and their ornaments are of the rudest possible
description.</p>

<p>Cultivation of the soil is only practised by the people
of one or two villages, and even then it produces but a
very small proportion of their food, so it follows that
most of their time and energies are devoted to procuring
the necessaries of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE</div>

<p>The struggle for existence is keen enough, the birth-rate
is low and the rate of infant mortality is, I believe,
very high. Nor do diseases spare them; syphilis is
exceedingly prevalent, and was probably introduced by
Chinese and Malay traders to the West end of the island,
whence it has spread along the coast. Tuberculosis is
happily absent, but two natives of Wakatimi were suffering
from what appeared to be certainly leprosy. Skin
diseases, notably <i>tinea imbricata</i>, are very common; and
almost every person appears to suffer occasionally from
fever of one sort or another.</p>

<p>But in spite of all these drawbacks the Papuans of the
Mimika are not such a very miserable people. They are
strong, those of them that survive the ordeals of infancy
and sickness; they have food in plenty to eat, if they
choose to exert themselves sufficiently to obtain it; they
have their amusements, songs and dances; and the manner
of their lives is suited to the conditions of the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
in which they live. It is this last consideration which
ought ultimately to determine their fate: they live in a
wretchedly poor country which is constantly liable to
devastating floods, and their habit of wandering from
one place to another, where food may be obtained, is the
only way of life suitable to the physical and climatic
conditions of the country.</p>

<p>Any attempt to “civilise” them must inevitably
destroy their primitive independence, and if it succeeded
in establishing the people in settled communities it would
reduce them at many seasons to absolute starvation.
We were visited once by the Director of the Sacred Heart
Mission at Toeal, which has done admirable work amongst
the natives of the Ké Islands and at one or two places
in New Guinea itself. When he had seen the people and
the nature of the country and had been told something
of their habits, he decided that the Mimika was not, at
present at all events, a proper field for missionary enterprise.
Setting aside all other considerations, one dares
to hope that such an interesting people may for a long
time be left undisturbed; they do no harm to their
neighbours and the effects on them of civilising influences
would be at the best uncertain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> it was the business of some of us during the
early months of the expedition to stop at the base-camp
and despatch canoes laden with stores up the river,
others remained at Parimau to establish there a second
permanent camp and to find, if possible, a way of
approaching the higher mountains. It should be said
that Parimau is some distance from the mountains—the
high point nearest to it. Mount Tapiro (7660 ft.) is some
twelve miles to the North, but it was no longer possible
to travel in the direction of the mountains by way of
the Mimika River, which had dwindled to a very small
size at Parimau, therefore it was necessary to find a
new route from there onward.</p>

<p>The first camp at Parimau was made on the shallow
sandy side of the river close to the native village; the
Papuans generally place their villages on gently sloping
rather than on steep banks for convenience in hauling
up their canoes. The coolies, such as there were of
them, were occupied on the river, the natives for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
first few months were of little or no assistance in
building, and the work was done almost entirely by
half a dozen of the Gurkhas. Their greatest achievement
was the construction of a log-house in the best
Himalayan style, probably by far the solidest building
that was ever put up in Dutch New Guinea. The floor
was raised about three feet above the ground and it
was well that the workmanship was good, for it had
not been finished many weeks before a flood swept over
the camp and everyone took refuge in the house, the
floor of which was just awash. Afterwards the camp
was moved to the high bank across the river and the
subsequent floods swamped the house and carried it
away piecemeal, but two of the uprights survived and
were still standing a year later.</p>

<p>We were a good deal annoyed at Parimau by the
<i>larvæ</i> of a small red and black beetle, which infested
the wood of which the frames of our huts were made.
These <i>larvæ</i>, which look like small hairy caterpillars,
were continually dropping from the roof and when they
were killed, or even touched, they emitted the most
disagreeable musky smell. They sometimes dropped
upon you during the night and the smell of them would
wake you from your sleep. The beetle itself too, if
crushed or irritated, has the same disgusting peculiarity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISCOVERY OF THE PYGMIES</div>

<p>It has been mentioned above (Chapter V.) that
Captain Rawling in exploring to the N.W. of Parimau
came to the big river Kapare, which we unsuccessfully
tried to navigate in canoes from below to the point
where he had met it. While he was walking up the
river bed one day, the Papuans who were with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
caught after an exciting chase two small men, whose
build and dress and appearance proclaimed them to
belong to another race than the Papuan. A day or
two later two more were captured, while they were
crossing the river; they were kindly treated and
presents were given to them, but they showed no
inclination to conduct strangers to their home, a large
clearing in the jungle on the hill side, which could be
plainly seen from the Kapare River. We learnt from
the Papuans that these little people were called Tapiro.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of March I accompanied one of the
food-transports up the Mimika and went with Rawling
out to the Kapare, where he had made a camp and was
occupied with some of the Gurkhas in cutting a track
through the jungle. By that time we had no coolies
available for land transport; in six weeks our fifty
coolies had diminished to ten, who were all wanted for
the canoes, so we were entirely dependent on native
assistance for land journeys. There was not much
difficulty in persuading people to carry loads for us
from Parimau to the nearest point of the Kapare River,
for they were accustomed to go over there to fish. But
it was a different business on the second day, when we
wanted to push the camp a few miles further up the
river so as to be in a better position for reaching the
clearing of the Tapiro. At first they resolutely refused
to start at all and retired to the shelters they had made
at a little distance from the camp. From there they
had to be led back by the hand one by one and then be
severally introduced to their loads, but even so a number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>of them ran away again, and it was hours before we
moved from the camp.</p>

<p>When once they were started they went steadily
enough for about a mile and then they all put down their
loads and refused to go on, but as they had stopped in
the middle of the bed of the river it was impossible to
remain there, so with promises of cloth and beads we
urged them on a little further. The same performance
was repeated a dozen times at intervals, which became
shorter and shorter until our coaxing and cajoling availed
no longer and there was nothing for it but to stop and
make a camp. It had taken us more than four hours to
cover less than three miles, most of which was easy going
over sand and stones in the bed of the river. We should
have been awkwardly situated if they had all gone away
and left us to carry the loads, as they did a few weeks
later to Marshall, who was deserted by them and forced
to leave some of his baggage behind him. Needless to
say, these misfortunes would not have occurred if our
Malay coolies had been suited to their work. As it was,
there were considerable periods when we had either to
make use of what help the natives consented to give us,
or else be content to do nothing at all.</p>

<p>When it suits them to do so, the Mimika Papuans
can carry very heavy loads and they manage to cover
the ground at a very respectable pace. They wrap up
the load in the mat made of <i>pandanus</i> leaves, which
every man always carries with him to serve both as a
sleeping mat and as a shelter from the rain. The mat is
securely tied by ropes of rattan or any of the other
innumerable creepers of the jungle, and two strong loops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
are made to pass over the shoulders so that the load
may be carried on the back, ruck-sack fashion. The
women carry loads as well as the men and sometimes
also the children, when the whole family is making a
journey.</p>

<p>From our upper camp on the Kapare River Rawling
and I made two attempts to reach the forest clearing of
the Tapiro, which could be easily seen from the camp at
a distance of about three miles in a straight line; but
though careful bearings of its direction were taken, it
turned out to be a most puzzling place to reach. Not
more than a mile above the camp the Kapare emerges
from a deep and narrow gorge in the foot hills—or rather
the spurs of the mountains, they are too steep to call
foot hills—which descend very abruptly to the almost
level country below. Just after it emerges from the
gorge, the river is joined by a stream of the clearest
water I have ever seen, which we afterwards came to call
the White Water (see illustration opposite).</p>

<div class="sidenote">BIRDS OF PARADISE</div>

<p>In our first attempt to reach the clearing we wandered
in the jungle for ten hours and came nowhere near to it.
But the day was not altogether wasted, for we climbed
up the hillside to about fifteen hundred feet and by
cutting down some trees we obtained a wonderful view
across the plain of the jungle to the distant sea. The air
of the jungle was heavy with the scent of the wild Vanilla,
and all around us were calling (but we could not see
them) Greater Birds of Paradise; sometimes we were
within sound of as many as six at one time. On that
day too I first saw the Rifle Bird (<i>Ptilorhis intercedens</i>),
one of the most beautiful though the least gaudy of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>birds of Paradise, whose long-drawn whistle can never
be mistaken or forgotten.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">A TRIBUTARY STREAM OF THE KAPARE RIVER.</p></div>

<p>In our second attempt we profited by some of the
mistakes made on the former, but even so the irregularity
of the ground and the complexity of the watercourses
nearly succeeded in baffling us. “Rawling and I left
camp early with two Gurkhas. A mile and a half up
the left bank of the river we struck off N.E. from the
path we followed the other day. Cut a new path
through the jungle for about a mile until we came to a
faint native track, which we followed for another mile
or so, chiefly along fallen tree trunks overhung by a
network of rattan and other creepers, a fearful struggle
to get through. Then for a mile or more up the bed
of a stony stream encumbered with the same obstructions,
dead trees and rattans, until we came to a deep
gorge with a torrent about three hundred feet below
us and on the opposite side the steep slope of another
great spur of the mountain, on which the clearing
presumably lay. We slithered and scrambled down to
the river, which was full of water and only just fordable.
Then up the other slope, not knowing at all accurately
the direction of the clearing. Very steep and the jungle
very dense with rattan and tree-ferns, so the leading
Gurkha was kept busily occupied in cutting with his
<i>kukrí</i> and progress was slow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WE VISIT THE PYGMIES</div>

<p>“About one o’clock, when we had been going for
nearly six hours, the clouds came down and it began to
rain and we were ready to turn back. Luckily the
Gurkhas were convinced that the clearing was not far
ahead and when we found a pig-trap, a noose of rattan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
set in a faint track, it seemed that they might perhaps
be right. So we went on and in a few minutes we came
out of the forest into the clearing. About thirty yards
from us was a hut with three men standing outside it.
We called out to them and they waited until we came
up. A minute or two later two more men came out
from the forest behind us, no doubt they had been
following us unseen. The hut was a most primitive
structure of sticks roofed with leaves, leaning up
against the hillside. There was a fire in the hut and
beside it was sitting an old man covered with most
horrible sores. We went on up the hill for a couple of
hundred yards to a place (about 1900 feet above the
sea) where we had a fine view. Rawling put up the
plane-table and got angles on to several points for the
map.</p>

<p>“During the hour or more that we stayed there, eight
men came to see us. Excepting one rather masterful
little man, who had no fear of us, they were too shy to
approach us closely and remained about ten yards
distant, but even so it was plainly evident from their
small stature alone, that they were of a different race
from the people of the low country.</p>

<p>“The most remarkable thing about them is the case
that each man wears, his only article of clothing; it is
made of a long yellow gourd, about two inches in
diameter at the base and tapering to about half an inch
at the pointed end. It is worn with the pointed end
upwards and is kept in position by a string round the
waist. As the length of the case—some of them
measure more than fifteen inches—is more than a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
quarter of the height of the man himself, it gives him
a most extraordinary appearance. Every man carries
a bow and arrows in his hand and a plaited fibre bag of
quite elaborate design slung on his back. Two men
wore necklaces of very rough scraps of shell and one
had a strip of fur round his head. Two others wore on
their heads curious helmet-like hats of grass ornamented
with feathers.</p>

<p>“One man had a diminutive axe made of a piece of
soft iron about three inches long, set in a handle like
those of the stone axes. They must have some bigger
axes, as they have cut down some very large trees and
the marks on the stumps look as if they had been made
with fairly sharp instruments. The clearing altogether
is very considerable, probably fifty acres or more.
The ground is covered with the sweet-potato plant, and
in many places ‘taro’ has been carefully picked out.
They have a few coarse-looking bananas, some of which
they offered to us.</p>

<p>“Their voices are rather high-pitched and one of
them, who met us first and called several of the others
to come and see us, ended his calls with a very curious
shrill jodelling note. When we came away we offered
them cloth and beads to come with us and show us a
better way, but they were either too frightened or too
lazy to do so. We got back to camp after ten hours’
hard going, drenched with rain and covered with
leeches, but well-pleased with the success of the day.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>That was the last that we saw for a long time of the
Tapiro pygmies, for it was evident that the Kapare River
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>was useless as a means of approach to the Snow Mountains
and we had to turn our attention to the country to the
N.E. of the Mimika. Moreover, it was impossible to keep
the camp there supplied with provisions, as we were at
that time entirely dependent for transport on the goodwill
of the Papuans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVES AS CARRIERS</div>

<p>Generally speaking we always remained on excellent
terms with the natives and very rarely had any trouble
with them. Except that we bought from them the
“atap” for our houses, we got little or no help from the
people of Wakatimi, but the people of Parimau assisted
us in a number of ways. At first, as I have shewn, we
had considerable difficulty in persuading them to work
for us as carriers; but when they found that they really
did receive the payment they were promised, they were
willing and sometimes even anxious to carry loads for us,
though we often had to wait a few days until it suited
their convenience to start. It was a pity that they were
never willing to travel further than about three days’
march from their village, but as there were long periods
when we were entirely dependent on them for land transport,
we counted ourselves lucky in their agreeing to work
at all.</p>

<p>Chiefly owing to the help of the natives we were able
to make and keep supplied for several months another
camp on the Wataikwa River, three days’ march north-east
from Parimau. When they went out there first,
they were accustomed to receive their pay, cloth and
beads or a small knife at the end of the journey; but
later, when wages rose, as they inevitably did with every
successive journey, it seemed to be absurd to waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
perhaps half a load by carrying axes and knives to be
given in payment at the end of the march. So a plan was
adopted of giving them at the Wataikwa camp a paper
authorising them to demand payment on their return to
Parimau, and it was a gratifying tribute to the confidence
that they had in us that they readily fell in with the
scheme. Before starting they were shewn the knife or
axe or whatever it was that they would receive for
their labour, and at the end they raced back with their
scraps of paper to Parimau, covering in a few hours the
distance that had taken them three days on the outward
journey. Some of the less energetic people in the village,
when they saw that their friends received a knife or an
axe by merely presenting a small piece of paper to the
man in charge of the camp at Parimau, thought that
they might easily earn the same reward, and they were
rather astonished to find that the small scraps of paper,
which they handed in, produced nothing at all or only a
serious physical rebuff. But they were so childlike in
their misdemeanours that one could not be seriously
angry with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OUR RELATIONS WITH THE NATIVES</div>

<p>They shewed their confidence in our honesty in another
very flattering way. During the period of the most
frequent floods at Parimau, when they were liable to be
washed away at any moment, the people took most of
their movable possessions out of their houses and hid
them in safe places in the jungle. But many of them
merely brought their goods across to our side of the river
and deposited them without any attempt at concealment
within a few yards of our camp, apparently knowing that
there they would be perfectly secure from theft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<p>They are by nature unconscionable thieves and a
chance of stealing is to them merely a chance of acquiring
property in the easiest way. On one occasion, when a
party of our coolies were returning alone from Parimau
to Wakatimi, they were waylaid at a narrow place in
the river by some Papuans, who relieved them of their
baggage and disappeared into the jungle; most of the
stolen goods were subsequently returned, when the
natives were threatened with punishment. The same
thing happened another time when the coolies were
accompanied by armed Javanese soldiers, who apparently
forgot the use of their rifles until the thieves
had got away. But they had a proper respect for a
white man and whenever one of us, armed or not, was
with the canoes, the natives never tried to molest us.
They occasionally stole from the camps a knife or an
axe, but though they were constantly about our houses
and often inside them for hours at a time, we never lost
anything of value.</p>

<p>A temptation, which often proved too strong for
them, was our fleet of canoes. At Wakatimi the canoes
were moored in front of the camp at the place where the
natives, who came to visit us, were accustomed to land.
They came mostly in the late afternoon and stayed till
sunset, and it happened several times that when they
went away they contrived to put two or three men into
one of our canoes and slip away with it unnoticed in the
dusk. But when on the following day we made a fuss,
the canoe was generally brought back with a long story
of its having been found floating down the river towards
the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>An opportunity of looting, which was not to be
resisted, occurred one day when a party of discharged
coolies were leaving the country. The boat, in which
they were being taken off to the ship, capsized as it
came alongside the steamer and thirty coolies and all
their belongings were upset into the sea. The captain
of the ship was only anxious to save his boat and the
coolies hastened to escape from the sharks. In the
meantime a crowd of natives, who had come down in
their canoes to visit the ship, lost no time in picking up
the floating boxes and bundles of clothing, and before
anybody was aware of their action they were fast paddling
away to their villages.</p>

<p>On such occasions and at other times when we had
reason to be angry with them, the people of Wakatimi
observed a curious custom. There was in the village a
coloured china plate and a piece of bent silver wire,
which was sometimes used by the owner as an ear-ring.
On the morning following their misdemeanour two men
came over from the village bringing the ear-ring on the
plate, which they gave to us, shook hands and departed.
Later in the day they returned and we gave them back
their gifts; this happened several times.</p>

<p>At one time there was a serious epidemic of drunkenness
among the people of Wakatimi and they shewed
their ill-manners by shooting arrows into the camp.
This was of no consequence when only one person misbehaved
himself. But when one day a number of men
waded half-way across the river and began to send
arrows into the camp, it had to be stopped. The Dutch
sergeant, who was alone in charge of the place at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
time, held up his rifle, a weapon the use of which they
very well understood, and signalled to them that unless
they went away he would fire. As they took no notice
of his warning he fired, aiming at the legs of the ringleader,
but unfortunately he hit him in the groin.
Shortly afterwards, so little animosity did they show
and so complete was their confidence in us, they brought
the wretched man over to our camp, but nothing could
be done for him and in a few hours he died.</p>

<p>They were very appreciative of medical treatment
and at different times we were able to do a good deal
for them. One man actually went so far as to pay a
fee of half a dozen coconuts for the saving of his little
daughter’s ulcerated foot, which was rapidly going from
bad to worse under native treatment. They often cut
themselves severely with our axes and knives before
they learnt their sharpness, and their wounds healed
astonishingly quickly with ordinary clean methods;
the only trouble was that they liked to take off the
bandages and use them for personal adornment.</p>

<p>As well as acting as carriers for us, the people at
Parimau did a considerable amount of work for us
about the camp in cutting down trees, an occupation
which they always enjoyed, and in helping to build
some of the houses. They were even more useful to us
as naturalists and, thanks mainly to them, we made a
very complete collection of the reptiles of the district.
They were particularly adept at catching snakes and
often five or six men in a day would stroll into the
camp carrying a deadly poisonous snake wrapped up
in leaves. One day Goodfellow was walking through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the jungle with some natives and the man in front
of him stooped down and picked up a poisonous viper
without even pausing in his stride.</p>

<p>We always encouraged the natives to bring us snakes
in the hope of getting new species, and when we did
not want those that they brought, they were quite
content to take them away and eat them. They seemed
to have a peculiar knack of catching poisonous things,
for besides snakes they often brought scorpions and
centipedes in their parcels of leaves. With the more
delicate creatures such as lizards they were less successful
and among the hundreds that they brought us
there were very few which they had not damaged.
They always assumed an air of importance and somewhat
of mystery, when they brought some animal for
sale, and you always knew that when you had bought,
or refused, as the case might be, the creature that was
offered, the man would instantly produce something
else, but the puzzle was always to know whence he
produced it, for his scanty costume does not admit of
pockets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A pleasant</span> interlude in the monotony of the early part
of the expedition occurred one day towards the end of
March, when the natives of Wakatimi signalled in the
usual way the approach of a boat and presently a steam
launch appeared with Europeans on board. They turned
out to be the Dutch explorer, Mr. H. A. Lorentz, who
was on his way back from his second and successful
expedition to Mount Wilhelmina by way of the Noord
River, with his companions Captain J. W. van Nouhuys
and Lieutenant Habbema, and the Captain of the
Government steamer <i>Java</i>, which had anchored off the
mouth of the Mimika. Mr. Lorentz looked like a man
hardly returned from the dead, as indeed he well might,
for after climbing to the snows of Mount Wilhelmina he
had fallen down a cliff on his return, with a result of two
broken ribs and serious concussion of the brain, and he
had endured untold sufferings on his way back to the
foot of the mountain. But he had achieved the principal
object of his expedition, and his spirits were in
better condition than his body. They stayed for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
night with us and at dinner, though I was in a minority
of one to six, with characteristic courtesy they all spoke
English; the entertainment, assisted by luxuries brought
from the <i>Java</i>, lasted until the small hours, and it was
the pleasantest evening I spent in New Guinea.</p>

<p>The <i>Java</i> brought for us the long-expected steam
launch, and its career began, as it ended, with disaster.
Before dawn one of the men of the boat wished to fetch
something that he had left on the launch, which was
moored in the river about fifteen yards from the bank.
The sentry on duty did his best to prevent him, because
it was a rule of the camp that no man was allowed to
bathe before sunrise, but he insisted on swimming out to
the launch. In a few yards he found that the current
was stronger than he had expected, he called for help,
and in a few moments a canoe set out in the gloom to
look for him, but no more was seen of him until his
body was recovered by the natives at the mouth of the
Mimika a few days later. Shortly after the accident
happened our guests left us on their way back to Europe,
and we watched their departure with somewhat envious
eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COOLIES AND GURKHAS</div>

<p>The history of the middle period of the expedition,
that is to say, from April to December, is chiefly a history
of floods and sickness and disappointment. In the
middle of April Goodfellow, who had gone away early in
March, returned with a fresh batch of forty-eight coolies,
whom he had recruited in Banda and Amboina. About
a half of these men were natives of the island of Buton,
and the rest were Ambonese, and though they were the
best men that could be found at such short notice, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
were greatly superior to our first batch of coolies, they
were really not fit for the work they had to do, and the
majority of them soon became useless to us.</p>

<p>The steam launch towed the canoes for a short distance
up the river once or twice, but it very soon broke
down and thenceforward until the middle of June all the
transport between Wakatimi and Parimau was done by
the coolies themselves. For them it was literally a killing
work; in the first few weeks two men died, one of
pneumonia, the other of dysentery, both causes resulting
from the circumstances of their work, while several
others developed the first signs of beri-beri and had to
be sent away at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>About the same time one of the Gurkhas died; he
was from the beginning a very unhealthy man, who
ought not to have been engaged for the expedition. Of
the other nine Gurkhas three were invalided home before
the end of the year and the remaining six stayed with us
until we left the country. Although they came from the
highlands of Darjeeling—or perhaps for that very reason—our
Gurkhas, who were by no means a carefully
selected lot, withstood the trials and the climate of the
country better than any of the other “native” people in
the expedition and, if expense were no drawback, it is
probable that an expedition to New Guinea would have
the best chance of success if coolies were taken from
Northern India.</p>

<p>That is, however, rather a counsel of perfection, and
an expedition to New Guinea must make use of natives
of the Malay Archipelago. The Ambonese and the
Butonese have been tried and have been found wanting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
so also have the Ké Islanders and the Sundanese from
the mountains of central Java. Possibly the wild hillmen
of Timor, if enough of them could be engaged,
would work well, but the only people who have hitherto
worked successfully as coolies in Dutch New Guinea are
the hill-Dayaks of Borneo. Mr. Lorentz, who took with
him eighty Dayaks, most of them from the Mendalen
River, on his expedition to Mount Wilhelmina, spoke
with enthusiasm of the admirable behaviour of his men,
and if Indian or other Asiatic coolies are not available,
it may be said that an expedition to the mountainous
districts of Dutch New Guinea can only be properly
conducted with Dayaks.</p>

<p>Our coolies were not the only people in the
expedition who began to feel the ill effects of the
climate; the Javanese soldiers and convicts quickly
filled the hospital which had been put up at Wakatimi,
and in May and June there were many mornings when
I saw more than forty sick men. Most of them suffered
from fever and a more or less severe form of dysentery,
and a good many cases of beri-beri occurred. Unfortunately
sickness was not confined to our native
followers only; the Europeans began also to suffer from
the very adverse conditions in which they found themselves.
One or two of the Dutch non-commissioned
officers became seriously ill; Goodfellow, who returned
with the second batch of coolies from Banda about the
middle of April, was never free from fever for more than
a few days from that time until he left the country in
October; and Shortridge became such a wreck from
almost continuous fever, which began about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
beginning of March, that by the end of May he had
to be sent away for three months’ change of air to
Australia. Soon after his return in August he succumbed
again to the evil climate, and though he pluckily
pretended that there was nothing the matter with him,
he went from bad to worse, and I am fully persuaded
that his almost forcible deportation at the end of
November saved his life.</p>

<p>At the end of May, Goodfellow and Rawling went
over to Dobo, and after about eight days returned with
the motor boat, which had been bought from the pearl-fishers.
Like most things of which a great deal is expected
the motor boat turned out to be a disappointment, and it
eventually led us into serious difficulty, but for a short
time it did good service in towing boats up the river, and
it considerably shortened the voyage from Wakatimi to
Parimau.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FIRST FLOOD</div>

<p>The day of the arrival of the motor boat was
memorable for being the occasion of the first of the
really serious floods that beset us. Late in the evening
a party of our coolies on their way back from Parimau,
who were not due to arrive until the following day,
reached the camp at Wakatimi, most of which was by
that time under water. The journey down the river
usually occupied two days, but they had found all the
usual camping places, some of which were high above
the ordinary river bed, under water, and they had been
unable to find any safe resting-place.</p>

<p>The three following days were among the most
unpleasant that I had ever spent, though worse were to
follow later. On the morning of the first day the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
fell a little and we spent laborious hours in piling up our
stores and movable gear on to the top of empty boxes,
and when those were all used on posts driven into the
ground. All through the afternoon the water rose, the
coolies’ and soldiers’ houses were quickly flooded, and
our own house, which was on the highest part of the
camp, was nearly a foot under water. On the two
succeeding days the conditions were much more serious,
and we had two feet of water in our house. The river
took a short cut over the neck of land formed by a wide
bend of the river on which the camp was placed and
flowed straight through the camp. Our beds were raised
up on empty kerosene-tin boxes, and when these were
submerged there was a mild excitement in guessing how
far up the frame-work of the bed the water would rise.
Fires were put out and cooking was impossible, so the
coolies and soldiers, who depended on their boiled rice,
had rather a hungry time. Our own food consisted of
biscuits and cold tinned stuff, which is not very exhilarating
when you have been in water all day long. An
unprejudiced observer looking in upon us from the outside
in the evening might well have wondered what kind of
lunatics we were to come to New Guinea. Goodfellow
was lying in bed very sick with fever, while Rawling and
I, up to our knees in water, were making a poor pretence
at having dinner. The only humour that we managed
to extract from the situation was in the novel experience
of being able, without moving from our seats, to wash
our plates between the first course of biscuits and
sardines and the second course of biscuits and marmalade;
the Mimika river was flowing under our chairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and we had only to lower our plates into it to clean
them.</p>

<p>On the fourth day the water fell, and the camp was
not flooded again for several weeks, but there was left
everywhere a thick deposit of mud, which kept the houses
sodden for a long time afterwards. In spite of all our
precautions, a quantity of stores were irreparably spoilt
and, worse still, the flood left behind it an increased
amount of sickness, and indeed the wonder was that the
prolonged soaking had not ill effects on every one of us.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July Cramer and I arrived at
Parimau, bringing with us the last loads of provisions
to complete the store, which we had been working hard
for three months with our second batch of coolies to
accumulate at that place. It was hoped that that store
would be sufficient to enable us to use Parimau as a
second base camp for making a prolonged expedition
into the mountains without wasting any more time on
transports up the river; but in that we had reckoned
without the vagaries of the New Guinea climate and the
consequent diminution of the effective strength of our
coolies, who were already too few for our purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSIONS BEYOND MIMIKA</div>

<p>In the meantime Rawling and Marshall had been
making excursions to the North-east of Parimau, in the
direction of the high mountains. About five miles from
Parimau they had come to the Tuaba River and about
the same distance further on they had come to the
Kamura River, a few miles above its junction with the
Tuaba. Continuing in the same direction they came
to another river, bigger than either of the others, the
Wataikwa, which was so often impassable that it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
likely to prevent any further progress. But a short
excursion up the valley of the Wataikwa showed the
impossibility of reaching the highest mountains by that
route, and a camp was accordingly established on the
Wataikwa with a view to crossing that river when an
opportunity should occur.</p>

<p>These excursions were all made with the assistance of
natives, without whose assistance no advance beyond
Parimau would have been possible, so long as all the
coolies were occupied in the work on the river. Very
little reliance could be placed on the natives, when they
were working as carriers alone without coolies, and most
of us at one time or another had the disagreeable experience
of being deserted by them and left unable to move
either backwards or forwards. It was in circumstances
such as these that the Gurkhas, some of whom always
accompanied us in journeys through the jungle, shewed
to the best advantage.</p>

<p>When the store of provisions at Parimau was completed,
the next step was to establish a further depôt of
provisions at the Wataikwa camp. Though the distance
between the two places was less than fifteen miles in a
straight line, it was a three days’ march for a loaded
coolie and two camping places were made on the way,
one on an island in the Tuaba River, the other on the
bank of the Kamura. The first day’s march from
Parimau began by crossing and recrossing the Mimika
several times and here and there wading up the river
itself. About three miles up the river we struck off
Eastwards through the jungle along a hardly visible
native track used by the people going to the village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Ibo; this was the only regular native track we used, and
these few miles across from the Mimika to the Tuaba
were the only place where we had not to cut our own
path. The mud in that part of the jungle was quite
exceptionally bad, even for New Guinea; in the comparatively
dry weather it was like walking through porridge,
and in the wet weather you were continually
struggling through liquid slime almost up to your knees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEECHES</div>

<p>We were very much annoyed there, though not more
in that than in other parts of the jungle, by the leeches
which swarmed everywhere. These hateful little creatures
sit on the leaves or twigs stretched out to their
fullest length and expectant of the passer-by. It is not
necessary to believe, as some people do, that they jump
or even that they fall upon you as you pass beneath
them; there are so many that as you brush through the
jungle you must inevitably touch many outstretched
heads and as soon as they are touched they attach themselves
immediately to you. They are extremely rapid in
their movements, and their touch is so delicate that you
do not feel their presence until they have nearly gorged
themselves with blood. Your legs, unless they are well
protected with putties, are most liable to their attacks,
but you find leeches on all parts of your body, and I
have found them in my eyes and in my mouth and once
just captured one as it was preparing to enter one of my
nostrils. They are able to consume an astonishingly
large quantity of blood, and when, as often happens,
they open a small vein, the bleeding continues after they
have dropped from their feeding place. It is not advisable
to pull a leech from your body; it often results in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
the creature leaving behind a part of its clasper, which
may give rise to a serious sore. Pigs do not appear to
be attacked by leeches, but the soft parts of the heads of
some of the cassowaries that were shot were found to be
covered with them. Cassowaries are few and far between,
and there must be millions of leeches that go through
life without once tasting blood. Some of the leeches are
prettily marked with stripes of yellow and brown, but
none that we saw in the jungle were of large size; the
longest were perhaps two inches in length.</p>

<p>Besides leeches there was not much to distract or to
amuse us in passing through that stage of the march—certainly
there were always plenty of the Greater Birds
of Paradise to be heard calling, but they were very
seldom to be seen—and we were chiefly anxious to
struggle to the end of it ourselves and to push the coolies
along until we heard the welcome sound of heavy water
and light showed through the trees ahead. The Tuaba,
at the place where we were accustomed to cross it, is a
wide river flowing in about half a dozen channels, which
extend over half a mile or more of ground. All of these
channels are considerable torrents even in the most
favourable conditions and it is by no means easy to cross
them, but in the very frequent times of flood they are
absolutely impassable. The camping place was made on
an island across the first channel, as the river bank proper
was covered with very dense jungle, and at low water
the island was surrounded by a stretch of dry sand and
shingle, which afforded us a pleasant drying ground after
struggling through the sweltering jungle.</p>

<p class="caption">TYPICAL JUNGLE, MIMIKA RIVER.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">A DANGEROUS FLOOD</div>

<p>But it was not always a place of calm; it could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>quite a dangerous place, and I had a very unpleasant
experience the first time I camped there. I was on my
way out to the Wataikwa river with a Gurkha, four
coolies and about twenty natives of Parimau laden with
tins of rice. The river was comparatively low when we
pitched our camp, but it began to rain in the afternoon,
and the almost continuous thunder and the black clouds
in that direction showed us that it was raining heavily
in the mountains. By nightfall the rising flood had completely
covered the sandbank in front of the camp, and
before midnight the river was flowing right through the
camp. The coolies were taking refuge like birds in the
trees, and the water had just covered my piece of ground,
which was an inch or two higher than any other spot.
The Gurkha came and helped me to secure the stores
from the water, which was still rising fast. We arranged
all the rice tins upright, and on them we placed my bed;
on the bed we placed all the other stores and baggage, and
finally I took refuge there myself. The water rose above
the top of the rice tins and about half way up the framework
of my bed and then happily it began to fall rapidly,
and in an hour or two the camp was land again. Shoes
of mine and odd garments of the coolies were washed
away, but we had been in no danger of being swept
away, for the current was not rapid enough over the
comparatively shallow water of the island; the only risk
was from the large logs and trees which came sweeping
down on the flood. The Papuans, who were encamped
on another island a short distance below ours, had kept
up all night a constant and most melancholy wailing,
which did not at all add to the humour of the situation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>For three more days we stayed on that sandbank,
while the rain poured down and the river swept past us
on both sides, unable either to proceed or to retreat. I
made two attempts to cross the river, but found it impossible
to struggle across the flood. In the meantime
the natives, who were well able to swim naked across
the first channel, threatened all the time to return to
Parimau. A few of them did leave me, but the rest
by constant cajoling and by liberal gifts of rice, for
which they had acquired a great liking, I persuaded
to stay with me until after four days we were able to
get away.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OVERFLOWING RIVERS</div>

<p>From the Tuaba to the Kamura river, a distance of
about four miles, a track had been cut by Marshall and
the Gurkhas. It was a curious piece of country, almost
level and covered with not very dense jungle, but remarkable
for the number of streams flowing through it.
Between the two rivers we crossed eighteen streams of
various sizes; some were rivulets, and others swift and
strong so that one was glad of a supporting Papuan
on either hand. The Kamura river is of less size than
the Tuaba, but it is still a large river and subject to
heavy and sudden floods. It flows in a bed of sand
and shingle two or three hundred yards from bank to
bank, though, except at times of flood, it only occupies
a narrow channel. Mostly it runs swiftly over the
stones, but here and there are long stretches of still
water like the pool of a salmon river; unluckily there
are no big fish in it, or New Guinea would be a pleasanter
place than it is.</p>

<p>It was an agreeable change to come out on to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
bank of the Kamura, for from there we had our first
wide view of the mountains that we hoped to reach.
The foothills, if mountains eight or nine thousand feet
high may be so described, sloped down to within a few
miles of us to the North, and behind them and stretching
far to East and West rose range beyond range of steep
and precipitous ridges, culminating in the snowy top of
Mount Carstensz, thirty miles to the North-east. Our
route took us for several miles along the course of the
Kamura; it was certainly not comfortable walking over
the big and often slippery stones and wading waist-deep
across the river three or four times to cut off big bends,
but it was pleasant indeed to have a wide free space
about us after having been for so long hemmed in by
trees, and anything was preferable to the mud and
leeches of the jungle.</p>

<p>A few miles up the Kamura we left the main river
and turned off up the bed of a smaller river, which joins
it from the East. This is actually a branch of the
Wataikwa connecting the two rivers, and down it comes
a great volume of water when the Wataikwa is full,
while at other times it becomes almost dry. The rivers
of this district of New Guinea are somewhat peculiar in
this respect; they are very numerous, and they flow out
from the mountains in a North to South direction, with
not many miles intervening between one river and the
next. As soon as they emerge from the mountains they
find themselves on quite low ground and with forty or
more miles to run to the sea. There are no outlying
hills or depressions to guide them in any particular
course, thus it happens that they overflow in convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
directions, and connections are established between one
river and another. As well as in the case of the Wataikwa
this was observed on the Utakwa river, close to
the foot of the mountains, and I believe the same thing
happens on the Kapare river. Further on in their
courses, when they approach the mangrove swamps
near the sea, the rivers again break up into an extraordinary
network of branches. Judging from the appearance
of the country and from the considerable changes,
which we observed in the case of the Wataikwa during a
period of only a few months, it is probable that these
great rivers change their courses very often.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUTTING A TRACK</div>

<p>Whilst parties of coolies, rapidly diminishing in
numbers, were occupied at lengthening intervals in
transporting stores from Parimau to the camp on the
Wataikwa river, Rawling and Marshall had found a
way of crossing that river. It is true that there were
a great many days when it was quite impossible to cross
it, and there was always a certain amount of risk of
being swept away, not to mention the discomfort of
beginning your day’s work by getting wet up to your
chest; but it was absolutely necessary to continue cutting
the track, wet or dry. On the other side of the
river, they had tried to continue in the North-east direction
and had come to broken lumpy ground covered
with the densest jungle that we met with in any part
of the country. The trees were not so very big, indeed
most of them were quite small, but they were of a peculiarly
hard wood, which quickly blunted the <i>kukris</i> of
the Gurkhas and they grew so close together that it was
quite impossible to push your way between them.
Eventually a track was cut to the Iwaka River, five
miles to the east of the Wataikwa.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p182.jpg" width="400" height="598" alt="AT THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE." />
<p class="caption">AT THE EDGE OF THE JUNGLE.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span></p>

<p>Some idea of the difficulty of cutting this track may
be learnt, when it is said that Rawling and Marshall
with three Gurkhas and five natives were occupied for
three weeks in cutting five thousand yards of the way,
and the whole distance of five miles was cut in five
weeks. Unfortunately it was labour in vain, the path
when finished was too difficult for men to traverse with
loads. We cut another track, which avoided the hilly
ground and brought us to the Iwaka close to the point
reached by the first; by the new track, which was cut in
a week, we were able to reach the Iwaka in three hours’
walk from the Wataikwa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> I were to write a true and complete account of the
expedition, I should fill many pages with repeated stories
of rain and floods, sickness among the coolies and our
consequent inaction; but that would be as wearisome
to the reader as it was trying to our own patience.
During July and a part of August we sent out parties of
coolies to the Wataikwa camp, where a considerable
depôt of food was formed, but about the middle of the
latter month the number of our coolies was reduced to
twenty, of whom not more than half were capable of any
hard work, and it became quite evident that any further
progress in the direction of the mountains was out of the
question until we should get a fresh supply of men.</p>

<p>As the number of coolies grew fewer we sent natives
with them to carry stores out to the Wataikwa, but the
supply of willing natives was very uncertain and it
became a matter of some difficulty to keep up a regular
communication with that camp. Two Gurkhas and two
Javanese soldiers remained always at the Wataikwa and
one or other of us went out there and stopped to make
natural history collections or to superintend the cutting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>of the road on the other side of the river for a few weeks
at a time, while the others were at Parimau or at Wakatimi.
We managed to continue this arrangement until
the end of October, when it became no longer possible to
keep an European supplied out there; thenceforward
until the beginning of January the camp at the Wataikwa
was occupied only by the guard of Gurkhas and
Javanese, who in the meantime consumed nearly all the
stores that had been so laboriously accumulated there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MALAY COOLIES</div>

<p>We often said hard things to and of our Malay coolies,
but the poor wretches were not to blame for being such
incompetent carriers. At their proper occupations of
carrying cargo to and from the ships at Macassar, or
working on the boats of the pearl-fishers, or doing odd
jobs in their native places, no doubt they excelled; but
at struggling through the New Guinea jungle with even
the lightest of loads they were hopeless failures and the
wonder was that they survived as long as they did.
Taking them all round, the majority of them worked as
well as they could, and some of them even became quite
attached to us.</p>

<p>To a large number of people the name of Malay
immediately suggests a savage person who runs <i>amok</i>,
but you may live for years in a Malay country and never
see a single <i>amok</i>. Fortunately our Malays never behaved
in this dangerous fashion, though one day a man
who was suffering from fever went suddenly mad and
inflicted a serious knife-wound on the body of another
coolie; the wounded man was successfully treated by
Marshall, who was happily but seldom required in this
way to exercise his vocation as surgeon. Malays are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
indeed rather too handy with their knives and a more
serious encounter took place one day between two of
Cramer’s convicts. These two men, a <i>mandoer</i> (head
man) and another, quarrelled one morning about some
trifle connected with their food, and before anybody
knew what was amiss, knives were out and one was
chasing the other through the camp. By a clever backward
thrust the pursued man dealt the pursuer a deep
wound under the heart, but he was unable to escape before
the pursuer had given him too a mortal wound.
One died in a few minutes and the other during the
course of the day, fortunately perhaps for both of them.</p>

<p>But ordinarily our Malays were most quiet and
peaceable fellows. Certainly they were liars and thieves
when it suited their convenience to be so, but these
two faults are almost universal in the East. They were
enthusiastic fishermen (a sure sign of grace) and spent
many hours of their leisure time in angling for small
fish, which they very seldom caught. Another of their
virtues, though it sometimes became a little wearisome,
was their love of singing, in which they indulged on
fine evenings. The Ambonese used to sing, accompanied
by a soloist on a sort of penny whistle, some
really pretty songs, possibly of Portuguese origin, to
which one could listen with real pleasure. But the
singing of the Javanese, usually in a high falsetto
voice, was a burden hardly to be borne.</p>

<p>In dealing with people like the Malays it is essential
to keep them constantly occupied in order to prevent
them from brooding too much over their untoward
circumstances and becoming, as they easily do,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
physically ill. Accordingly, during the times when for one
reason or another they were not carrying out loads to
the Wataikwa camp, we set them to clearing the jungle
about the camp at Parimau, and in the course of time
some ten or twelve acres were cleared. Apart from
the object of drying and letting light into the camp,
this clearing was made with the purpose of obtaining
from Parimau a view of the Snow Mountains. This
latter object was ultimately attained and proved of
great service to the surveyors, who were enabled to
fix more definitely the various points of the range seen
from a place of which they had already determined
the position by astronomical observations. To the
non-surveyor too the view of the mountains was a
boon, though rather a tantalising one, and I used to
spend many hours in the mornings, before the mists
had hidden them, in scanning the snows of Idenburg
and Carstensz and planning routes by which they might
be reached.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FELLING TREES</div>

<p>Cutting down trees in the New Guinea jungle differs
from cutting down trees here in that the tree does not
always fall, even when the trunk is cut completely
through. Amongst the tops of the trees grows an extraordinary
network of rattans and other creepers of
sufficient strength to support a tree, even if it is inclined
to fall. We spent some time one day in firing shots
with a rifle at a single creeper, thicker than a man’s
arm, which was holding up a tree without any other
support; though I believe we sometimes pierced the
creeper with bullets, it held on and only gave way some
hours later. As a rule we did not take the trouble to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
cut the creepers, but if a tree did not fall we cut down
those about it until they all fell together in one splendid
crash. On sloping ground the best method of felling
trees is to cut their trunks only half way through and
leave them, and then to cut completely through a big
tree above them in such a way that it will fall down
hill and complete the felling of those below it.</p>

<p>Some of the trees that we cut down in our clearing
fell in the most unexpected directions, but though there
were some narrow escapes, there were no accidents.
The most unpleasant was a tree which fell midway
between two houses, one full of coolies and the other
full of stores, and shaved off the projecting roof of
both; it might easily have killed half-a-dozen sleeping
men, but the only harm it did was to fill the camp with
a swarm of large and furiously biting ants, which had
had a nest in its topmost branches. The natives, who
never tired of using our steel axes, helped a good deal
in felling the trees and in this way some of them earned
large quantities of coloured beads.</p>

<p>Another occupation for the coolies in their idle
moments, and at the same time a very necessary work,
was the business of keeping the camp in a state of repair.
When the high river bank opposite the village of Parimau
was chosen for a camping ground, it was thought that
floods at all events could do no harm. The houses
nearest to the river were built five or six yards back from
the edge of the bank, which was there about fifteen feet
above the usual level of the water, and it seemed quite out
of the question that the river could ever invade the camp.
It was necessary, in order to prevent it from becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>the dumping ground of camp-refuse, to clear away the
rank vegetation that grew on the bank down to the
water’s edge, and this was the beginning of what almost
ended in our downfall. After the tangle of creepers had
been removed, the first rains began to wash the bank
away, and when the river rose three or four feet, as it
speedily did after a few hours’ downpour, it undermined
the lower part of the bank and large landslips took place
from above.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CAMP AT PARIMAU. A PRECAUTION AGAINST FLOODS.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">SECURING THE CAMP</div>

<p>In the course of a few weeks several yards of land
disappeared, and the safety of our houses, which had
come to be almost overhanging the river, was seriously
imperilled. To save them we erected a strong palisade
of long poles thrust deeply into the bottom of the bank
and secured them by rattan ropes, which passed through
our house and were attached to posts at the back. The
interval between the palisade and the bank was
laboriously filled up with shingle from the river bed, and
this provided a never-ending occupation, because the
stones were always trickling through the palisade and
required to be renewed. The natives were of great
assistance to us in this work, and on one occasion—it was
the only time that we ever persuaded them to come into
our camp, although we lived within a few yards of their
village—the women and children came and helped in the
work and thoroughly enjoyed themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOODS</div>

<p>It was well that we took these precautions, for as the
weather grew steadily wetter and wetter (though that
seemed hardly possible) through July and August, so the
river rose higher and higher and each succeeding flood
was greater than the last. The night of the 18-19th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
August was one that I shall never forget: it had been
raining steadily for some days and the river was fairly
full, but about sunset on the 18th the rain really began
to come down solidly, as it does in the Tropics. About
midnight a terrific thunderstorm began, which continued
with almost incessant thunder and lightning until dawn,
but long before this the river had risen many feet and
was already threatening the village. As soon as the
waters began to rise the natives appeared at the edge of
the river with blazing torches, while canoes were baled out
and brought nearer to the shore. When the flood, rising
visibly by that time, reached the lowest house, a most
extraordinary Bedlam broke loose and it sounded as if all
the people in the village were being drowned. The men
all shouted at once, the women and children screamed
and the dogs whined and howled. By the light of the
flashes of lightning we could see them scurrying hither
and thither, bundling all their belongings into the canoes
and trying to save the roofs and matting walls of their
huts by throwing them among the branches of the trees
at the back of the village. In a very short time all the
houses were swamped and the people were in their
canoes, about twenty in all, moored to the branches of
the trees along the edge of the jungle, where they kept
up an unceasing turmoil until daylight.</p>

IN CANOES." />
<p class="caption">THE SAME IN FLOOD. THE VILLAGE HAS DISAPPEARED AND THE PEOPLE ARE
IN CANOES.</p></div>

<p>In the meantime our own position was not very
secure. The river was swirling down at ten or twelve
miles an hour and bringing with it huge tree-trunks,
which carried away our fleet of canoes and threatened
to destroy our protecting palisade. If that had gone
nothing could have prevented our houses from falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>into the river, but happily it held well. The whole of
the jungle on our side of the river was under water and
all sorts of creatures sought the shelter of our houses,
which occupied the highest position. When even these
were flooded, armies of ants and beetles and other insects
climbed up our beds and other furniture to escape from
drowning, moths washed out of their resting places
fluttered aimlessly about, and a family of rats, which
inhabited my hut, ran about squeaking in terror.</p>

<p>Beyond the loss of our canoes, some of which were
afterwards recovered, no great damage was done, and
the flood fell almost as quickly as it had risen. Soon
after daybreak the ground, on which the village had
been, began to appear above the falling water, and it
was seen that not one stick of the huts was standing.
But the natives were anxious to get out of their canoes,
and by mid-day half the huts in the village were re-built
with the fragments that they had crammed into the
canoes or had put up into the trees. During the next
two or three days they brought back quantities of housing
materials, which had been carried for miles down
the river, and very soon the village resumed its normal
appearance.</p>

<p>On two subsequent occasions in the following month
the village was completely swept away by floods, and it
was a matter of surprise to us that they did not adopt
the custom of their neighbours the Tapiro pygmies and
build their houses on piles. The third great flood swept
away the sandbank on which the village stood, and they
were accordingly compelled to build their houses on the
top of a high bank further down the river. Such a place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
as that necessitated cutting down a number of big trees,
but now that a great many of them have the steel axes,
which we gave them, it is to be hoped that they have
learnt to place their dwellings in safer positions, even
though it costs them a little extra labour.</p>

<p>The wet season, which we hoped had reached its
maximum of wetness in July, when sometimes for
days together the rain hardly ceased, continued in a
series of greater or less floods through the months of
August and September. Often it was impossible to
move a yard from the camp, and without books life
would have been almost insupportable. On one of
the wettest of those days I came across the following
passage, which seemed to describe the situation
exactly:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“With five ... what we call qualities of bad,</div>
<div class="line">Worse, worst, and yet worse still, and still worse yet.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It need hardly be said that this very disagreeable
season produced ill effects on all the members of the
expedition. The Europeans became depressed, and if
we were not sick of life itself, we were certainly sick of
New Guinea, while in the case of the coolies and soldiers,
who were accustomed to sunnier climates, and who had
no interest or goal to look forward to in the country, the
results were disastrous indeed. Hardly a man escaped
fever of greater or less severity and chills brought on by
the unceasing rain and the consequent impossibility of
securing a change of dry clothing. Several men suffered
too from dysentery of a very intractable type, which
completely incapacitated them from any further service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERI-BERI</div>

<p>But worse than either fever or dysentery was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
beri-beri, which made its appearance after we had been
in the country for a few months. This is not the place
to give a scientific account of beri-beri; it will suffice to
say that it is a disease, of which the most important
feature is a degeneration of the nervous system. The
results of this are seen in the curious and characteristic
walk, loss of sensation in various parts of the body,
interference with the circulation and swelling of the
body and particularly of the face and limbs, and in very
many cases sudden heart failure. It is almost conclusively
proved now that the cause of the disease is an
error of diet, and it appears to be certain that the fine
milling and polishing of the rice, which forms the staple
food of the natives of so many countries in the East,
deprives the rice of a very necessary constituent as a
food. Those people, who grind their own rice and do not
mill or polish it finely, but leave a small portion of the
husk still adhering to the grain, are free from beri-beri.
The disease varies in severity from time to time and
from place to place, but at its best it is a very deadly
scourge and it causes a very large number of deaths.
Occasionally it occurs in an epidemic form, but fortunately
that did not happen to our expedition.</p>

<p>In the six months from the beginning of June to
the end of November, thirty-nine men shewed definite
symptoms of beri-beri, and seven deaths were directly
attributable to this cause. Our coolies, who came from
the Eastern islands of the Archipelago, were much less
susceptible to the disease than were the convicts and
soldiers, most of whom came from Java and Sumatra;
these latter contracted the disease in a much more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
serious form and most of the fatal cases took place
among them. It was a curious circumstance that at
Parimau, which was in most respects by far the healthier
place, many more cases of beri-beri occurred than at
Wakatimi, where it is doubtful if any cases originated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SICKNESS</div>

<p>Still more remarkable was the case of the camp on
the Wataikwa River, which ought to have been the
healthiest place we occupied anywhere in the country.
For several months a guard of two Javanese and two
Gurkhas was kept there to look after the store of food,
and though they were very frequently changed and
replaced by others, several of the Javanese developed
beri-beri and two of them died. The Gurkhas, perhaps
because they led more active lives than the Javanese,
remained free of the disease until one of them, Havildar
Mahesur, a most useful man, had the misfortune to
damage one of his eyes; it was necessary for him to
remain in the darkness of his tent for some days and
within a fortnight he developed all the signs of beri-beri
so that he had to be sent away from the country.</p>

<p>A welcome interruption in those dreary months was
caused by the arrival at Parimau on August 26 of canoes
bringing Mr. C. H. B. Grant, who had come out from
England as naturalist to the expedition in the place of
W. Stalker. He brought with him two Dayak collectors<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
and a quantity of various and excellent stores, and a
large mail, the first we had received since the end of May.
Shortridge had arrived in the country by the same ship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>on his return from Australia, but his change of air had
not completely cured him and he was compelled to leave
the country at the end of November. Goodfellow, whose
fever continued almost without interruption, became so
weak that he also was obliged to leave the country early
in October. From that time we had only a dozen men
and no forward movement was possible until the arrival
of our third batch of coolies on the 22nd December. By
the same boat that brought the new coolies in December
came instructions to Captain Rawling to take over the
command of the expedition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TAPIRO PYGMIES</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pygmy people—or Tapiro as they are called by the
Papuans—whom we saw in March, visited us occasionally
in small parties of three or four at Parimau and later we
went to one of their villages in the hills, to which they
were reluctantly persuaded to show us the way. When
they come down to Parimau they were warmly welcomed
by the Papuans, with whom they seemed to be on very
friendly terms, and stayed in their houses for two or
three days. They appeared to be particularly attractive
to the women, one of whom we saw affectionately embrace
a Tapiro on his arrival; it was said that she kissed him,
but if that was so it was the only occasion on which that
form of endearment was seen practised by the Papuans.
It was noticeable that when they arrived at Parimau
they had not their bows and arrows, which they always
carry elsewhere; probably they had left them hidden in
the jungle before they came to the village. Similarly,
when we went up to visit the Tapiro, the Papuans who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>were with us left their spears behind them at the last
camp before we reached their village.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p196.jpg" width="400" height="654" alt="A TAPIRO PYGMY." />
<p class="caption">A TAPIRO PYGMY.</p></div>

<p>Their visits were always very welcome because they
brought with them from the hills quantities of tobacco
to exchange with the natives of Parimau, who grow
none themselves. At first they were very shy of crossing
the river, but by the offer of gifts we persuaded
them to come into our camp, where we had better
opportunities of observing them than in the crowded
village.</p>

<p>At one time or another we took measurements of
40 adult men, most of them men in the prime of life,
and their average height was found to be 144·9 cm. (4 ft.
9 in.). It is possible that one or two rather tall men
of 150 cm. and upwards, whose appearance led us to
suspect that they were Tapiro-Papuan half-breeds, may
have been included among those measured, but the
correction of that error will not appreciably reduce
the true average height. The height of the smallest
man measured was 132·6 cm. By contrast with the
Papuans they looked extremely small and, what was
rather a curious thing, though many of our Malay
coolies were no taller than they, the coolies looked
merely under-sized and somewhat stunted men, while
the Tapiro looked emphatically <i>little</i> men. They are
cleanly-built, active-looking little fellows, rather big in
the buttocks as mountain people are apt to be, and
their well-made calves are noticeable in contrast with
the long, straight legs of the Papuans. They walk
with an easy swinging gait, the knees a little bent and
the body slightly leaning forwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>The colour of their skin is paler than that of the
Papuans—some of them indeed are almost yellow—but
they are so indescribably dirty that it is not easy to
know what is their true colour; they have also an ugly
habit of smearing their faces with a black oily mixture.
Neither tattooing nor cicatrization appears to be practised
by them. The <i>septum</i> of the nose is always
pierced and in it they occasionally wear a curved boar’s
tusk planed down to a thin slip, or a short piece of
straight bone; the <i>alae nasi</i> are not pierced. The nose
is straight and very wide at the nostrils. The upper lip
of many of the men is long and curiously convex.</p>

<p>The hair is short and woolly and black; many of
the men give a lighter shade to the hair with lime or
mud, and in two or three cases it seemed to be of a
brown colour without any artificial treatment. They
appear to begin to grow bald at a comparatively early
age. The younger men grow whiskers and the older
have short bushy black beards. There is a good deal
of short downy black hair scattered about the body.
Their eyes are noticeably larger and rounder than those of
the Papuans, and there is in them something sleepy and
dog-like which gives a pathetic expression to their faces.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DRESS AND ORNAMENTS</div>

<p>When we first saw them one or two men wore
curious helmet-like caps of plaited fibres and another
had a strip of fur round his head; otherwise they are
completely naked except for the remarkable gourd
case described above (p. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>). Strangely enough they
are extremely modest and unwilling to expose themselves;
when with some difficulty we had persuaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>a man to part with his case, he would not remove it
then and there, but always disappeared into the jungle and
returned after an interval decently covered with leaves.</p>

<p>Their ornaments are few and simple; a number of
men wear arm-bands and leg-bands of plaited fibre
similar to those worn by the Papuans, and several of
them wear necklaces of seeds, short pieces of bamboo,
scraps of broken shell, teeth of wallabies and (in one
instance) the bones of a small mammal. The lobes of
both ears are pierced and a few men wear in one ear an
ornament made of a small piece of gourd to which are
attached seeds, scraps of fur, claws of birds and other
ornamental odds and ends. One young man, with more
originality than the rest, thrust through his front hair a
piece of sharpened bone, which projected downwards
over his face and gave him a most distinguished appearance
(see Frontispiece).</p>

<p>The most elaborate and ornamental of their possessions
are the bags, which every man carries. Most of
them carry two, a large bag like a haversack slung
across the shoulders and usually hanging down the back,
and a small bag only a few inches square slung round
his neck and hanging down on the chest. They are
made of fine fibres of different colours, cleverly netted<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
in ornamental patterns, and they show the best attempt
at decorative art that we saw in the country. In these
bags the Pygmy man keeps all his portable property.
The small wallet round the neck contains his bone and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>shell ornaments when they are not in use, and his knives;
these latter are sharp flakes of a flint-like stone shaped
exactly like the flint-knives and scrapers that are found
in this country; they are used for scraping down the
wood of their bows and for pointing and ornamenting
their arrows as well as for other cutting purposes, and it
is profoundly interesting in these days of steel to see
people still using the implements of prehistoric man.
One or two men also carried in their wallets a short
dagger made of a pointed cassowary’s bone, and they
explained to us by graphic gestures how they were
accustomed to shoot a cassowary with their arrows and
then after a long chase to stab it with the dagger.</p>

<p>The contents of the larger bag usually are the sleeping
mat, the fire-stick and rattan, and tobacco. The
sleeping mat is a fabric of <i>pandanus</i> leaves, which can
be used either as a mat to lie upon or as a shelter from
the rain; it measures usually about six by three feet and
is neatly folded to be carried in the bag. The manufacture
of these mats is always the work of the women and
is a very ingenious process. The long ribbon-like leaves
of the <i>pandanus</i> are split horizontally into two strips;
the shiny upper one alone is used and the lower is
thrown away. Strips of two leaves are placed with their
split surfaces together and their shiny surfaces outwards,
and then numbers of these pairs of split leaves are sown
together, edge to edge, until the mat is of the required
size. Thus the mat is made entirely of the outer
surfaces of the leaves; it is very strong and is quite
impervious to rain.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting of the possessions of these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>people is the apparatus for making fire, which consists
of three different parts, the split stick, the rattan, and
the tinder. The split stick is a short stick of wood an
inch or so in diameter, which is split at one end and is
held open by a small pebble placed between the split
halves. The rattan is a long piece of split rattan wound
upon itself into a neatly coiled ring (see illustration p. 202),
and the tinder is usually a lump of the fibrous sheath
of a palm shoot and sometimes a piece of dried moss.</p>

<p>The method of making fire is as follows: In the split
of the stick, between the stone which holds the split ends
apart and the solid stick, is placed a small fragment of
tinder. The operator—if one may use so modern a word
in describing so ancient a practice—places the stick upon
the ground and secures the solid, <i>i.e.</i> the unsplit end with
his foot. Then, having unwound about a yard of the
rattan, he holds the coil in one hand and the free end in
the other and looping the middle of it underneath the
stick at the point where the tinder is placed he proceeds
to saw it backwards and forwards with extreme rapidity.
In a short space of time, varying from ten to thirty
seconds, the rattan snaps and he picks up the stick with
the tinder, which has probably by this time begun to
smoulder, and blows it into flame. At the point where
the rattan rubs on the stick a deep cut is made on the
stick, and at each successive use the stick is split a little
further down and the rattan is rubbed a little further
back, so that a well-used fire-stick is marked with a
number of dark burnt rings. It was only with the
greatest difficulty and after many attempts that we
succeeded in producing fire in this manner, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Tapiro do it with the utmost ease and they scorned our
boxes of matches, which we offered them in exchange for
their apparatus, and showed no signs of surprise at a
suddenly kindled match.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The most frequent use of the fire-stick is in lighting
the tobacco, of which nearly every man carries a supply
in his larger bag. These people cultivate tobacco in
sufficient quantities to be able to supply the Papuans of
the low country. The leaves are dried and neatly rolled
up into long bundles weighing three or four pounds; the
flavour is strong and rather bitter, but it is not unpleasant
to smoke. The Tapiro smoke tobacco chiefly
as cigarettes, using for the wrapper a thin slip of dry
<i>pandanus</i> leaf. When, as is often the case, the wrapper
is very narrow and the tobacco is inclined to escape, the
man smokes his cigarette in a peculiar manner; he holds
the unlighted end in his fingers and with his mouth
draws out the smoke from between the edges of the
wrapper in the middle of the cigarette, this he continues
to do until the cigarette is about half consumed when he
puts the end in his mouth in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>The Tapiro also smoke tobacco in a pipe in a fashion
of their own. The pipe is a simple cylinder of bamboo
about an inch in diameter and a few inches in length.
A small plug of tobacco is rolled up and pushed down to
about the middle of the pipe, and the smoker holding it
upright between his lips draws out the smoke from below.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>The Tapiro never make large cigars like those of the
Papuans of the Mimika, and the Papuans never smoke
pipes, nor did they take readily to those that we gave
them.</p>

<p class="caption">MAKING FIRE: (2) BLOWING ON THE SMOULDERING TINDER.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">WEAPONS OF THE PYGMIES</div>

<p>Besides the bone daggers mentioned above the only
weapon of the Tapiro are the bow and arrows, which they
always carry. The bows are a very little shorter than
those of the Papuans, but otherwise they are very
similar, viz.: straight tapered strips of hard wood
“strung” with a slip of rattan. The arrows are shorter
and lighter and of finer workmanship than those of the
Mimika Papuans, but like those they have neither
feathers nor nocks. The best, which they were not at
all anxious to sell to us, are ornamented with simple
carvings and are tipped with a very sharp point of black
wood. An arrow which ended in a curious blunt lump
of wood was used, so we understood, for shooting birds.</p>

<p>The Tapiro have no spears and neither they nor the
Mimika Papuans know the use of the sling. They set
quantities of little nooses for small animals, and we once
found a rattan noose fixed to a root of a tree and evidently
set with the purpose of catching a pig.</p>

<p>Many of them carry in their bags a small Jew’s harp,
made of a thin piece of bamboo, from which they extract
faint music that is pleasing to their ears. Two men
possessed instruments of a more original design: these
were made of pieces of polished bone fitting together in
such a way that when one was turned round over the
other it produced peculiarly discordant squeaks, which
were highly appreciated by the player.</p>

<p>Wamberi Merbiri or Wamberimi, the village of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Tapiro which was visited by different members of our
party on three separate occasions, is situated on the
lower slopes of Mount Tapiro, the mountain nearest to
Parimau, at about 1800 feet above the sea. It is in
fact within a stone’s throw of that large clearing which
Rawling and I had reached with so much difficulty, but
when approached by the track used by the people themselves
it is an easy walk of two or three hours from the
Kapare River.</p>

<p>The track climbs by a steep almost knife-edged ridge
densely covered with forest to the rounded shoulder of
the hill where the village lies. The first sign of the
village is a flimsy fence of tall poles, which bars the track
and extends for a short distance on either side of it.
Passing through a narrow opening in the fence you come
to a cleared space occupied by three or four houses. A
couple of hundred yards beyond these and separated
from them by a small gully, which is bridged by an
enormous fallen tree, is a second group of six houses,
constituting the village of Wamberi Merbiri.</p>

<p>The houses are scattered about over three or four
acres of steeply sloping ground, from which most of the
trees have been cleared. Between the houses the ground
has been levelled in three places to form almost level
terraces, measuring about fifteen by five yards, completely
cleared of vegetation and covered with small
stones. These terraces are held up on the lower side by
logs and stumps of trees, and the labour of making them
by people whose only tools are stone axes and pieces of
wood is difficult to imagine; they are used, so far as we
could understand, for dances and other ceremonies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p class="caption">WAMBERI-MERBIRI, THE VILLAGE OF THE TAPIRO PYGMIES.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">HOUSES OF THE PYGMIES</div>

<p>The houses are greatly superior to those of the Mimika
Papuans, from which they differ in every respect. They
are built on piles, which raise the floor of the house from
four to ten feet above the ground according to the steepness
of the slope underneath. The walls are made of long
laths of split wood with big sheets of bark fastened on
to the outside. The roof is a fairly steep pitched angular
structure of split wood covered with over-lapping leaves
of the Fan-palm. The floor is made like the walls and
covered with large sheets of bark; in the middle of the
floor is a square sunken box filled with sand or earth in
which a fire is kept burning, and over the fire hanging
from the roof is a simple rack, on which wood is placed
to dry. The house consists of one nearly square compartment,
measuring about ten feet in each direction.
The way of entering is by a steep ladder made of two
posts tied closely together, which leads to a narrow
platform or balcony in front of the front wall of the
house. There are no notches on the posts, but the
lashings of rattan, which tie them together, answer
the purpose of steps or rungs for the feet. As well as
in the excellence of their houses, the Tapiro show another
point of superiority over the neighbouring Papuans in
their habit of using a common retiring place at the edge
of a small stream.</p>

<p>There was an old man in the village, bald and white-bearded,
and horribly disfigured by disease,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> who appeared
to be unquestionably the headman of the place.
He sat in one of the huts all day and shouted shrilly to
the other men who were constantly going in and out to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>speak to him, and I think it was due to him that we
were never allowed to see the women. We were particularly
anxious to see some of the women of the tribe,
and we offered them large rewards of knives and axes
merely for the sight of them. The other men were
willing enough to produce the women, and several times
they were on the point of fetching them, but were
always prevented by the old man. Finally we had a
personal interview with him, and held out three bright
axes, which made his one eye glisten with greed, but
he still remained obdurate.</p>

<p>Though we never saw the women I have no doubt
that they saw us; at night we saw their camp fires up
on the hillside opposite the village, and when we departed
we heard their shrill voices quite close to us before we
had gone a quarter of a mile from the place. They had
no reason to distrust us when we assured them that our
only wish was to see their women, and I think the reason
for their keeping them hidden was the presence of the
Papuans who accompanied us from Parimau. The supply
of Papuan women is very scanty, and it is likely enough
that the men would seize any chance of abducting a
Tapiro woman, as indeed they boasted of having
done.</p>

<p>The language of these Tapiro pygmy people is certainly
different from that of the Papuans, but I regret to
say that we were unable to make even the smallest
vocabulary of it. Their voices are rather high-pitched
and nasal, and many of their words contain curious
throat sounds, which I was not able to spell much less
to imitate. In talking they have a curious habit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>protruding the lips, which recalls in a striking manner a
familiar grimace of the anthropoid apes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p206.jpg" width="500" height="363" alt="HOUSE OF THE TAPIRO." />
<p class="caption">HOUSE OF THE TAPIRO.</p></div>

<p>They appeared to understand a good deal that the
Papuans said to them, but I doubt if the latter understood
them when they were talking amongst themselves.
When we were trying to persuade the headman to allow
the women to be produced, it was a strange experience
to be using the Papuans, of whose language we knew
only the rudiments, as interpreters to an even less known
people.</p>

<p>In consequence of our entire lack of knowledge of
their language we were not able to form a very reasonable
estimate of their intelligence. When they were seen
in company with the Papuans, the latter, who usually
looked dull and expressionless, appeared by contrast to
be full of life and animation. The Tapiro, as a rule,
looks blank and rather sad, and when a smile does appear
upon his face, it dawns slowly and reluctantly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COUNTING</div>

<p>A rough test of an uncivilised man’s intelligence is
the extent to which he is able to count, but in the case
of the Tapiro there is an unfortunate difference of evidence
in this respect. Capt. Rawling (<i>Geograph. Journal</i>,
Vol. xxxviii., page 246) affirms that they are able to
count up to ten. If this is so, it is a very interesting
and remarkable fact. On several occasions I tried to
make these people count, with a view to learning their
numeral words, and I found that like the Papuans they
only had words for one and two, and that those two words
were the same as the Papuan words; but it appeared
that, unlike the Papuans, they had not the custom of
using their fingers and toes for the higher numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>On the credit side of their intelligence must be placed
their admirably constructed houses, their decorated
arrows and ingeniously woven bags, and their cultivation.</p>

<p>As well as the village and clearing of Wambiri Merbiri
we saw other small patches of cleared ground on the
spurs of Mount Tapiro, and on the slopes of Mount
Tuaba we saw from a distance another large clearing
which we were never able to reach. Further to the East
we saw no sign of them and we were informed by the
Papuans that there were no more in that direction. That
is probably true, for the mountains are so excessively
steep to the East of Mount Tuaba that there appears to
be no country suitable for them. It seems likely that
we were fortunate enough to meet these people at the
Eastern limit of their range and that more of them would
be found living in the hills N.W. from the Kapare River
towards the Charles Louis Mountains, where the slopes
are less steep than in the Nassau Range. The thick-coated dog,
which was brought down to Parimau by the
Tapiro (see p. 126), might suggest that they have dealings
with other natives living high up in the mountains, but
so far we have no definite knowledge of the existence of
such a people.</p>

<p>This account of our observations, which were necessarily
very superficial, will suffice to show that there is a
most promising field for some future investigator, who
has opportunity and time to spend among these most
interesting people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been mentioned in the preceding chapters that
after the expedition landed in New Guinea, a more or
less regular communication was kept up between the
Mimika and Amboina. The South-west coast of New
Guinea as far East as the Utanata River is in the
administrative district of Amboina, and beyond that, as
far as the boundary of British New Guinea, the country
is nominally under the control of the station of Merauke.
Thus the Mimika is actually within the Merauke district,
but it was for many reasons found more convenient for
the Government to communicate with the expedition
directly from Amboina rather than by way of Merauke;
accordingly the soldiers forming our escort were attached
as an outpost to the garrison of Amboina and communications
were established with that place.</p>

<p>For several months a steamer came from Amboina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
to the Mimika, bringing men and stores and letters
and taking away invalids; usually it came every six or
eight weeks, and the longest interval that occurred was
twelve weeks, during which for one reason or another
it was found impossible to send a ship to the Mimika.
In October an alteration was made, and it was decided
that the Merauke steamer, which was in regular communication
with the Dutch expeditions on the Utakwa
and Island rivers, should visit the Mimika also. It was
in consequence of this new arrangement on the part of
the Government that I was enabled to make the journey
described below, and although these places do not fall
strictly within the sphere of our expedition, yet they are
so little known that I shall make no apology for giving
a short description of them here.</p>

<p>Towards the end of November, the Government
steamer <i>Valk</i> called at the Mimika on its way to the
Utakwa and Island rivers to take away our sick men,
who had accumulated in some numbers during the last
two months. Our work was practically at a standstill,
and nothing more could be done until our next batch of
coolies arrived, so it was agreed that I should go down
to Merauke in company with Shortridge, who was going
home an invalid, and bring back our new coolies who
were due to arrive there by the next boat early in
December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE UTAKWA RIVER</div>

<p>A few hours’ steaming from the Mimika brought us
to the mouth of the Utakwa, where we lay outside the
bar all night waiting for daylight to find our way into
the channel. When we had entered the river it was
evident that the Utakwa was something very different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
from the Mimika, which is a mere ditch in comparison
with it; it is indeed to the Mimika as the Severn is to
the Wye. It was tantalising to remember that this was
the river by which we had originally intended to enter
the country, and one could not help regretfully wondering
what would have been the result if we had followed
out that plan; but it was at the best an unprofitable
speculation, and one had to rest content (or as content
as possible) with the course we had taken. In any case
it was certain that even if we had taken the Utakwa as
our point of entering into the country, we could not
possibly have reached any considerable height in the
Snow Mountains with the means, i.e. the men, at our
disposal.</p>

<p>Near its mouth and for some miles inland the
Utakwa is about half a mile wide and bounded by low
banks of Mangrove and Nipa-palm. The <i>Valk</i> was a
ship of about five hundred tons drawing twelve feet of
water. We steamed up the river for about seventeen
miles and there anchored, not from lack of water, but
on account of the risk of turning the ship round against
a strong current in the somewhat narrowing channel.
From the anchorage a steam launch and boats were sent
on to the base camp of the Government expedition,
which had been established rather more than thirty
miles further up the river.</p>

<p>We waited for three days while that expedition was
being brought away, and after the first day the <i>Valk</i>
went down to the mouth of the river on account of the
mosquitoes at the anchorage; they were a small black
species, and they came out of the swamps by day as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
as by night in swarms, and attacked everybody on board
so furiously that life became quite intolerable. Before
we left the anchorage up the river we saw a magnificent
view of the snows of Mount Carstensz towering up over
the morning mists. From there the Snow Mountains,
making as it were a steep wall across the view to the
North, appear far more imposing than they do in the
rather sidelong view from the Mimika; and the different
aspect of the precipices as seen from the Utakwa was
most instructive.</p>

<p>Whilst we were waiting at the mouth of the river
we were visited by several parties of natives in canoes,
who came, they informed us, from a large village on the
Kupera Pukwa, the next river to the west of the
Utakwa. They appeared to use the same, or almost
the same, language as the people of Mimika, and they
were very anxious that we should go and visit their
village, but unfortunately we had no means of doing so.</p>

<p>An interesting sight at the mouth of the Utakwa
were the Dugongs (<i>Halicore australis</i>), which were seen
feeding on the weeds in the shallow water and occasionally
rose up and stared at us in a curiously human
manner. They are about eight feet long and are
perfectly inoffensive creatures, but they have been
“fished” for with nets and almost exterminated in
many places on account of their valuable oil.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUTCH EXPEDITION</div>

<p>The Dutch expedition came down to us in detachments
during the three days that we waited at the
mouth of the river. There were Captain Van der Bie, in
command; Mr. J. M. Dumas, surveyor and naturalist;
three white sergeants, about fifty native soldiers and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>convicts, and twenty Dayaks of Dutch Borneo, who
came down the river in the long canoes they had built
themselves. There was also an Australian collector,
Mr. Meek and two assistants, who had been attached to
the Dutch expedition to make collections of birds and
butterflies for a private museum in England. With Mr.
Meek were ten natives of Port Moresby in British New
Guinea, little brown, fuzzy-headed fellows full of life and
merriment; they were in every way so different from the
sombre and unemotional Papuans that it was difficult to
realise that they were both natives of the same island.</p>

<p>The Utakwa expedition had been in the country for
seven months and had traversed a considerable extent of
country, but those months coincided with the period of
the worst weather—one cannot talk of wet and dry
seasons in that region—and like us they had suffered
from the shortcomings of their coolies; the Dayaks had
reached them too late to be of much service to the expedition.
From their base camp at the head of steam-launch
navigation they had gone two days further up
the river in canoes, and then had gone a distance of
seven marches towards Mount Carstensz. The furthest
point they reached was at an altitude of about 3000 feet,
and was less than twenty miles distant from the snow,
but the views of the country that they saw were not sufficient
to show whether that was the best route to the
highest mountains. One of the principal objects of the
Government in despatching that expedition to the Utakwa
was to discover a convenient way of crossing New
Guinea, and when it was found that the Utakwa led
apparently to the highest mountain in the island, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
decided to withdraw the expedition, and to concentrate
all the exploring energies on the Island River, which
seemed to offer a better prospect of accomplishing that
purpose.</p>

<p>When all these people had been taken on board the
<i>Valk</i>, the decks of the little ship were crowded to overflowing
with gear and men and wild animals. They had
brought some young wild pigs, a number of crowned and
other kinds of pigeons, and several young cassowaries.
Mr. Dumas brought on board three eggs, from which
were hatched pretty little cassowary chicks during the
next few days. We were particularly struck by the
appearance of the Dayaks, any one of whom looked more
than a match for three of our Malay coolies. Apart from
their apparent strength, they differed noticeably from
the Malays, who like to spend their days in sleeping
between meals, in their unceasing industry; they had
brought on board quantities of bamboo, from which
they at once started making bird cages, and pieces of
hard wood, out of which they carved handles for their
knives and other ornamental objects.</p>

<p>The ship was so heavily laden that it was impossible
to take on board all the boats that had been used by
the Utakwa expedition, and three or four were towed
in a long string astern. Fortunately the sea was exceptionally
smooth, but even so one of these, an almost
new “long-boat,” broke adrift, and we lost a day in
searching for it unsuccessfully.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONVICT LUNATIC</div>

<p>Whilst we were cruising about looking for the lost
boat, one of our passengers, a fever-stricken soldier from
the Mimika, caused some excitement by stabbing with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
his knife another man and then jumping hastily into
the sea. The sudden plunge cooled his fever and the
appearance of a sea-snake swimming not far from him
made him as anxious to return to the ship as he had
been to leave it.</p>

<p>During the voyage down the coast we saw a number
of sea-snakes, sometimes as far as thirty or forty
miles from land, but there was no opportunity of
catching one; they appeared to be yellowish with dark
markings and were about three or four feet in length.
I was told that they sometimes travel in large numbers
together and will climb up the sides of ships at anchor,
but I cannot vouch for the correctness of this statement.</p>

<p>Another episode, which enlivened the voyage down
to Merauke, was caused by the strange behaviour of
one of the convicts, who was being taken away from the
Mimika. This man had suffered from the common
form of delusion that everybody was against him, and
after he had run away from the camp at Wakatimi
and had spent thirty-six hours in the jungle without
food I certified that he was of unsound mind and
recommended that he should be sent back to Java.
He was found prowling about the ship with an exceedingly
sharp knife, with which (so he said) he intended
to murder me, so he was promptly secured in chains.
We made friends in a day or two and he was set at
liberty again before we reached Merauke, but I confess
I was not sorry when we were no longer together in the
same ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ISLAND RIVER</div>

<p>On the second day after leaving the Utakwa we
entered the Island River by one of its many mouths,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
and after we had gone up it a few miles we realised
that in the matter of size it is to the Utakwa as that
river is to the Mimika. The banks are low and swampy
and mostly covered with mangroves for several miles
from the coast. Further on the banks are a few feet
above the level of high water and we saw many trees
that looked like good timber trees and others of considerable
beauty, notably a wide-spreading acacia-like
tree (<i>Albizia moluccana</i>), and a very graceful palm
(<i>Oncosperma filamentosum</i>) like a Betel-nut palm growing
in clumps by the waterside. We noticed also a
number of Bread-fruit trees (<i>Artocarpus</i> sp.) bigger
than any I have seen elsewhere, but none of them
appeared to bear fruit.</p>

<p>We steamed up the river for one hundred and twelve
nautical miles to the <i>Swallow</i>, the depôt ship and base
camp of the Dutch exploring expedition. The river at
that point is about three hundred yards wide, but the
current is swift and there are many shallow sand banks,
which make further navigation impossible for a ship as
large as the <i>Valk</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">A PAPUAN WITH TWO TAPIRO PYGMIES.</p></div>

<p>The Dutch expedition had been established for several
months in the country and had made very considerable
progress towards the North. From the <i>Swallow</i> they
had proceeded up the river two days’ journey by steam
launch and six days beyond that by canoes as far as the
river was navigable, a distance of more than one hundred
miles. Thence they had gone North, and in nine marches
they had reached a height of ten thousand feet at a point
which appeared to be on the watershed of the main
mountain range of the island. One of the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>objects of the expedition was to cross New Guinea from
South to North, and it was hoped that from the furthest
point they had reached they would soon arrive at one of
the upper tributaries of the Kaiserin Augusta, the large
river which enters the sea in German territory. They
were at that time busily occupied in transporting supplies
up to their furthest camp with a view to continuing the
journey, but shortly afterwards the expedition was
crippled by sickness and the project was abandoned.
We spent two days alongside of the <i>Swallow</i> transferring
to her the stores and many of the men that we had
brought from the Utakwa and taking away the sick and
time-expired members of the Island River expedition,
amongst them being Lieut. Van der Wenn of the Netherlands
Navy, who was attached to the expedition as
surveyor.</p>

<p>On our way down the Island River we saw many
things which we had missed on the way up, because we
had entered the river and steamed up through several
hours of darkness. First we came to isolated houses by
the river bank of the same type as the Mimika houses,
but larger and better built; near them we saw a few
natives, who appeared to be very shy and retreated hastily
into the jungle when the steamer approached.</p>

<p>Lower down, when we were within about thirty miles
of the sea, we came to a large village of fifty or sixty
houses, some of which were raised on piles near the edge
of the river and the others were built in the trees, where
they presented a most astonishing appearance. They
are square and apparently well-made houses with ridgepole
roof and walls of “atap,” the entrance is by a hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
in the floor which is reached by a vertical ladder of
bamboo from the ground. One house was at a height of
certainly not less than sixty feet above the ground in a
very slender tree, and the position of the inhabitants,
when the wind blew, must have been far from enviable.
Unfortunately the sun was low and directly behind the
village so that I was unable to obtain photographs of the
tree-dwellings. The people there showed no fear of us,
but stood on the bank and shouted and waved their
spears.</p>

<p>A few miles further down the river we came to
another large village of yet a different character. The
houses there were all built on piles, but while a few of
them were of the usual small size, the majority were
quite unlike anything else we had seen in that part of
New Guinea. They were huge barn-like structures raised
on piles ten or more feet above the ground, and the
length of some of them must have been from one hundred
and fifty to two hundred feet. It was quite evident that
these were communal dwellings, indicating a social
system entirely different from that of the surrounding
districts, and it was very tantalising to pass them within a
few yards and not to be able to visit them. The village
extended for about a mile along the East bank and the
natives that we saw must have numbered at least a
thousand. The men were all entirely naked and the
women were only dressed in the scantiest strip of bark-cloth.
In other respects they appeared, as far as one
could tell from such a rapid survey of them, to be very
similar to the Mimika Papuans in their features and
their short hair and their absence of adornments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">INTERESTING PEOPLE</div>

<p>Crowds of people lined the river bank and some of
them, holding short bamboos in their hands, jerked them
in our direction and from the end came out a white cloud
of powdered lime, which looked like smoke. This custom
was noticed by Rawling when he first visited the village
of Nimé, and it was recorded by some of the early
voyagers,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> but the meaning of it has not yet been
explained. The suggestion that it is a means of imitating
the appearance of fire-arms is ingenious, but it can hardly
be seriously considered.</p>

<p>While most of the people stood on the bank to see us
pass, a number of men jumped into their canoes and came
racing after us. The current of the river was about two,
and the speed of the <i>Valk</i> was seven knots, so they had
to move quickly, but they easily overtook us and followed
us for some distance down the river. Their canoes are
simple “dug-outs,” but they differ from those of the
Mimika in coming to a fine point at both ends. The bow
is roughly notched on the upper side, which gives it
somewhat the appearance of a bird’s beak. They seem
also to be considerably lighter than the Mimika craft, and
so narrow that a man could hardly sit down in them.
The usual number of a crew is nine or ten men, who all
stand up and all paddle on the same side of the canoe.
The regular swing of their bodies and the perfect precision
of the paddling was a sight prettier than any
“eight” I have ever seen. They called to us and waved
bundles of arrows, evidently anxious to trade with us,
but the captain of the <i>Valk</i> was unable to stop, so we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>threw overboard for them empty tins and bottles, and it
was marvellous to see how they raced up to these things,
and with a sudden backward stroke of their paddles
brought the canoes to a standstill, while they recovered
the prize, and then raced on again.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Island River, as we went out
to sea, we saw through a break in the clouds to the far
North the snow on Mount Wilhelmina, which was
reached by Mr. H. A. Lorentz in November, 1909.
Steaming in a south-easterly direction we kept some
way out from the land, which is so low as to be invisible
at a distance of a few miles. When we were opposite
the Digoel, the greatest (excepting the Fly) of all the
South New Guinea rivers, we found the sea strewn with
logs and trees, in some places so many together as to
form floating islands, on which crowds of gulls and terns
were seen to settle at nightfall.</p>

<p>The tide favouring us, we chose the Marianne Strait
between the mainland and Prince Frederick Henry
Island. Sometimes, when the south-east monsoon has
been blowing regularly for a few days, it is quite impossible
for a ship of only moderate power to steam
through it against the current. The Strait is a winding
channel about ninety miles long and has an average
width of about two miles, and it is not surprising that
early voyagers, even as late as Kolff, in the Dutch
brig-of-war, <i>Dourga</i>, in 1826, mistook it for a river.
The banks are low and forest-covered, and we only
saw two small clusters of houses. From one of these
some men put off in a canoe to intercept us and
followed us for some distance, calling “<i>Kaya-Kaya</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>”
(friend).<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> They were tall and powerful-looking men,
entirely naked except for a small shell attached to a
string about the middle, and their great mats of hair
extending down to the shoulders and beyond showed
most clearly that we had come to yet another tribe
quite distinct from the people of the Island River.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JAN CARSTENSZ</div>

<p>Jan Carstensz, who visited this coast in 1623, gives
a good description of the land and the people:<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> “It
is impossible to land here with boats or pinnaces
owing to the clayey and muddy bottom into which
a man will sink up to the waist, the depth of the
water being no more than three or four fathoms at
three or four miles distant from the land. The land
is low-lying and half submerged, being quite under
water at high tide; it is covered with wild trees,
those on the beach resembling the fir-trees of our
country, and seemingly bear no fruit. The natives
are coal black like the Kaffirs and they go about
stark naked. They have two holes in the midst of
the nose, with fangs of hogs or sword-fishes through
them, protruding at least three fingers’ breadth on
either side, so that in appearance they are more like
monsters than human beings, they seem to be evil-natured
and malignant. The lands which we have
up to now skirted and touched at not only are barren
and inhabited by savages, but also the sea in these
parts yields no other fish than sharks, sword-fishes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>and the like unnatural monsters, while the birds too
are as wild and shy as the men.” Further to the East
he found the people “cunning and suspicious, and no
stratagem on our part availed to draw them near
enough to us to enable us to catch one or two with
nooses which we had prepared for the purpose.”
Suspicion of the unknown is in the nature of savage
people, and when we read that “in order to frighten
them the corporal fired a musket, which hit them
both, so that they died on the spot,” we no longer
wonder that they appeared to Jan Carstensz to be
“evil-natured and malignant.” But times have changed
and the Dutch navigator of to-day is not less humane
than any other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MERAUKE</div>

<p>After coming out of the Marianne Straits we noticed
a change in the appearance of the land; the smoke of
villages appeared at frequent intervals and the shore was
seen to be fringed by a continuous belt of coco-palms
in place of the mangrove to which we had become
accustomed. In a few hours from the Marianne Straits
we came to the mouth of the Merau River and after
steaming up it for about four miles we dropped anchor
opposite the Dutch station of Merauke, where we left
the ship and went ashore.</p>

<p>The Dutch people have an inborn preference for low-lying
land on which to place their stations, but not the
most enthusiastic fenman would have voluntarily chosen
Merauke as a place for a settlement. The reason of its
existence is a political one. Formerly the natives of the
district, the Tugeri, a very fierce and warlike people,
used to have the habit of making raids to the Eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>into British territory, whence they brought slaves and
the heads of their fallen enemies. This became such a
nuisance that the Australian Government addressed protests
to the Dutch about the lawless behaviour of their
subjects, and in 1902 the Dutch made the station of
Merauke, and established there a small garrison of about
one hundred men. The place was chosen partly because
it was in the centre of the district of the Tugeri, and
partly because on that shallow coast the Merau River
alone offered a safe harbour for ships. It is a dreary
enough place on the muddy bank of the river and surrounded
on the other sides by swamps, but the Dutch
have made the best of a bad job, and by laborious ditching
and dyking they have made the place fairly secure
from floods; in spite of all their draining, however, there
are more mosquitoes there than in any other inhabited
place I have ever visited.</p>

<p>Like other Dutch settlements Merauke is laid out on
a regular and spacious plan, plenty of room being left
between the houses of the officials and the quarter
occupied by the shops of the Chinese, of which there are
about a dozen. There are (or were in 1910) sixteen
Europeans<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
in the place, all of them in the employment
of the Government except two, the representatives of an
European trading firm. The principal trade of the place
is in copra obtained from the hundreds of thousands
of coco-palms, which line the neighbouring sea-shore.
These palms are the property of the natives, who are too
lazy to take advantage of the wealth that lies (or rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>hangs) at their doors, and they do not encourage other
people to come and make use of it.</p>

<p>There is a small force of native police under a Dutch
officer, and a few convicts are employed in keeping the
station in order. It may not be out of place to remark
here that the nearest Dutch settlement is at Fak-fak on
the S.W. corner of the MacCluer Gulf, seven hundred
miles in a straight line from Merauke. Besides these two
places the only other Dutch garrison is at Manokwari
(Dorei Bay) on the north coast, where there has been a
mission station for more than fifty years. Apart from
civilian and military officials, missionaries and two or
three agents of a commercial firm there are no settlers in
the huge territory of Dutch New Guinea.</p>

<p>A former Resident of Merauke, who had somewhat
inflated ideas of the future of the country, established
an experimental botanic garden on the only patch of
dry ground near Merauke. Attached to the garden is a
large building containing rooms for three Europeans,
laboratories, a dark room and so on, which (it was
hoped) would attract scientific agriculturists and botanists
from other countries to come and study the local
<i>flora</i>. But no sane person wishes to study the <i>flora</i> of
New Guinea in the middle of a swamp, and already the
scanty soil was showing signs of exhaustion at the roots
of the experimental bananas, and the practically-minded
Resident was considering the removal of the house to
Dobo or elsewhere as a dwelling for himself, when the
contemplated abandonment of Merauke as a “Residency”
should take place.</p>

<p>Another interesting building at Merauke is the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
of the Mission of the Sacred Heart, an offshoot from the
mission at Toeal. It must, I am afraid, be admitted
that Merauke is not a favourable field for missionary
enterprise, and the most notable achievements of the
good fathers there are the admirable house they have
built, and the herd of cattle which they contrive to keep.
They teach a very small class of the native children, but
nearly all of them relapse again very soon into savagery,
and the adults, who have remained faithful to the mission,
are very few, and they are not the best specimens
of their race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOAT BUILDERS</div>

<p>Recently the ubiquitous Chinese have discovered that
the sea in the neighbourhood of Merauke is a most
profitable fishing ground, and the results of their labours
are spread abroad to dry in the sun, so that there are
times when the air is almost too strong to be breathed.
The fishery has attracted some men from the Ké Islands,
who are the best boat builders in the Eastern Archipelago,
and I spent many hours watching them at their
work. Their tools consist only of an axe, an adze and
an auger, and no nails or metal are used in the construction
of a boat. The planks are about three inches thick
and are made each from a single tree hewn to the
required shape. Holes are bored at intervals along the
edge of the plank, and into these are fixed pegs of wood
which fit into corresponding holes in the edge of the succeeding
plank. When the shell of the boat is completed,
the ribs, each made from a single piece of bent wood, are
fitted to the inside. The fitting of the planks is so accurate
that the boats require little or no caulking, and they
are ready to take the water as soon as they are built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">NATIVES OF MERAUKE</div>

<p>But by far the most interesting feature of Merauke
are the natives of the place, whose independent mien
and conservative customs fill the observer with admiration
if not with approval. It is now nearly ten
years since the Dutch settled at Merauke, but in all
that time, apart from curbing somewhat their head-hunting
propensities, they have made very little impression
on the natives, who still cling (if one may
use somewhat of an Irishism) to their scanty costume
of nothing at all, and refuse absolutely the beads and
cloth and other “trade-goods” of the invading white
man. They stroll about the place in a most lordly
manner, and they like to visit the houses of the
Europeans, where they spend hours disdainfully watching
other people at their work.</p>

<p>In appearance they differ from the Papuans of
the Mimika in their somewhat paler skin and in
their features, which are markedly of the (so-called)
“Semitic” type with prominent eyes and long, curving,
fleshy nose. They are very fond of personal adornment
and paint their faces with white, red, and yellow colours;
a fashionable but very unsightly decoration is to paint
the eyelids and eyelashes white. Through the <i>septum</i> of
the nose is thrust a long piece of white bone or shell, and
in the <i>alae nasi</i>, which are also pierced, are often worn
the claws of a large eagle which project forwards, and
give the man a most ferocious aspect (see illustration
opposite).</p>

<p class="caption">NATIVES OF MERAUKE.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the more dandyfied individuals are loaded
with necklaces of shells or teeth of dogs, sharks and
crocodiles, and bands or belts of the same things are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>crossed on the chest. Rings of boars’ tusks and plaited
fibres almost cover the upper arms, and in the ears are
worn bunches of large rings of tortoiseshell and bamboo.
The hair is long and is plaited with a mixture of mud
and grass and feathers into a solid bunch, which hangs
down beyond the level of the shoulders. In some of
these head-dresses I saw plumes of the Greater, the Red
and the King birds of Paradise; it appears that when
once they are made these head-dresses may be added to,
but they can never be undone, and they are accordingly
indescribably dirty. These people are characterised by
a pungent and most disagreeable odour, quite different
from the sickly sweet smell of the sago-eating Mimika
people.</p>

<p>Another curious custom of the Merauke natives is
their habit of wearing round the waist a belt of pigskin,
which cannot be removed, and is so tight that
it constricts the man to an (apparently) most painful
degree; the women of the tribe do not indulge in this
practice.</p>

<p>Two days after our arrival the monthly mail-steamer
came bringing our forty-eight new coolies from Macassar,
and on the following day it sailed again, taking Shortridge
on his way back to England. For a week longer
I received the most kind hospitality from the Resident,
Mr. E. Kalff, until we returned to the Mimika. During
that week of waiting our new coolies, who had heard
terrible stories of the Mimika, declared that they would
never go there, and they attacked with knives the
guards who were placed to keep them in order. When
I told them that if they had no liking for the Mimika<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
they were perfectly at liberty to go and live near
Merauke, the stories they heard of the habits of the
Tugeri put an immediate end to the strike, and they
came contentedly enough to the Mimika. They were
more fortunate than some of their predecessors, and all
returned to their homes at the end of the expedition.</p>

<p>The Dutch have a pleasant sentiment with regard to
the customs of their native land, and at Merauke, the
most remote outpost of Holland, the feast of S. Nicholas
was celebrated with due ceremony. All the Europeans
in the place, as well as the Javanese sergeants and clerks
and their children, assembled to meet the Saint, a huge
Dutchman disguised out of all recognition, and all of us,
brown and white alike, received at his hands a present or
a mock flogging according to our deserts.</p>

<p>After spending ten very agreeable days at Merauke
we sailed on December 18th and going by way of the
Island River, where we landed fresh men for that expedition,
we arrived again at the Mimika on the 22nd
December.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> our third and last batch of forty-eight coolies
reached the Mimika towards the end of December, it
was at once evident from their appearance that the
majority of them would not last very long, and as we
had ourselves been already for a year in the country,
it was agreed that we should make a final effort to penetrate
as far as possible towards the mountains, and
that when our means of transport came to an end we
should take our departure from New Guinea.</p>

<p>We had long realised the impossibility of reaching
the Snow Mountains from our present base. If we
had possessed an efficient steam-launch or motor boat,
the Mimika was still too small a river and too frequently
unnavigable to be useful as a route for water transport.
Another consideration even more important than this
was the fact that had the Mimika been ten times the
size it was, it would still have taken us in a direction
many miles to the West of the mountains we hoped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
to reach. The result of these two circumstances was
that we travelled by water with great labour to a
place (Parimau), which was still in low and often
flooded country, and from there we had to travel across
country for many miles before we came to the first
rising ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CROSS-COUNTRY JOURNEYS</div>

<p>It is difficult enough in New Guinea to make a way
up a river valley, but you always have the comforting
reflection that the river itself leads you back to your
base, when stores are exhausted and it is time to return.
But when you attempt to make a cross-country journey,
not only is the trouble of cutting a track much greater
than it is in a river bed, but there is the difficult and
often somewhat dangerous business of crossing the
rivers; added to this is the risk, which increases with
every river you cross, of being cut off for a longer or
shorter period from your base camp and supplies by
a sudden flood in those same rivers. For this reason,
when coolies were sent back from an advanced camp
to the base, they had to be supplied with an extra
allowance of food in the event of their being stopped by
floods on the way; such a proceeding meant diminishing
to some extent the store of food they had carried out
and a consequent waste of labour. It is essential, therefore,
in trying to make a long journey in such a country,
to discover beforehand the river valley which will take
you nearest to your goal and thus avoid the risks of a
long cross-country journey.</p>

<p>No time was lost in sending a fleet of canoes heavily
laden with stores up the river from Wakatimi, and
early in January the whole expedition was assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
at Parimau with supplies sufficient for three months.
On the 14th January Marshall and Grant with two
Dayak collectors, forty-six coolies, thirty-one Papuans,
and about forty soldiers and convicts, by far the largest
number of men we had ever sent off at one time, set out
for the Wataikwa river. A few of them went on with
the Europeans to the Iwaka, where a track was cut
for two marches up the valley of that river, while the
rest, after leaving their loads at the Wataikwa depôt,
returned to Parimau to fetch more loads of stores.
From the Wataikwa the coolies carried on the stores
to the upper camp on the Iwaka river, a three days’
march, and at the beginning of February Cramer and
I went up there with the last party. About a hundred
and fifty loads of one kind or another had been carried
up from Parimau in these various excursions, but unhappily
the coolies ate up a good many of the loads
on the way, and still more unhappily many of the
coolies fell sick, so that if we had wished to send back
to Parimau for yet another transport of stores, it would
probably have ended in our having no coolies to carry
them any further.</p>

<p>The nett result of all this carrying was that when
we arrived with the last loads at the Iwaka depôt we
found that we had only twelve days’ provisions for
our party of three Europeans, two Dayaks and the
twenty-two coolies who survived from the forty-eight
of a month earlier. Cramer had food for about the
same number of days for his party of soldiers and
convicts. Such a meagre supply of provisions as that
obviously made it out of the question for us to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
penetrate far into the mountains; but you must in
New Guinea, as elsewhere, cut your coat according to
your cloth.</p>

<p>The Iwaka at the place where we first came to it
is a tremendous torrent flowing in rather a narrow
stony bed. A little way further down it spreads out
into a wider channel like that of the Wataikwa, but it
is much larger than that river and though we searched
down stream for three or four miles, we found no place
where it was possible to cross.</p>

<p>As we went up the river we very soon found that
the river banks became steeper, and it was soon evident
that we were at last among the hills. There was a
peculiar satisfaction in bending one’s legs to go up
hill after having been for so many months on almost
level ground. The track was not at all easy, for it
appeared that in many places large slices of the hillside
had slipped down, bringing with them a chaos of dead
and living trees over which we had to pick a precarious
way. In some places we crept along the edge of the
torrent, and in others we climbed high up the hillside
to avoid a precipice where the river ran through a
narrow gorge; but it was all a pleasant change from the
monotonous jungle of the plains. There was more
variety in the vegetation too as we went on; creepers
arranged themselves prettily on the rocky river bank,
and Fan-palms, which we had not seen before, grew in
groups in the more level places. There was a tree
growing in many places whose lower branches were
covered at that season with small pink flowers, which
lent a grateful splash of colour to the usually gloomy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>green of the jungle. There was an invigorating air
of mountains in the river as it came thundering over
the huge boulders in its bed, and now and again we
even got a glimpse through the trees of the mountains
themselves, apparently not so very far distant
from us.</p>

<p class="caption">LOOKING UP THE MIMIKA RIVER FROM THE CAMP AT PARIMAU.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE UNFORDABLE IWAKA</div>

<p>Two days’ scrambling up the valley brought us
to the rest of the party at the depôt camp, and there we
learnt the very unwelcome news of a discovery, which
seemed likely to put an immediate end to our explorations.
The advanced party had climbed up a spur
to the west of the river and had seen that the Iwaka,
instead of flowing (as we imagined) from the North-east
by an apparently wide valley, actually flowed from
the North through a deep, and in some places precipitous
gorge, which we could not possibly attempt
to traverse with our feeble coolies in the short time
that remained to us.</p>

<p>If we were to advance at all, it was necessary for
us to go in a North-easterly direction, but there we seemed
to be completely cut off by the torrent of the Iwaka
River. Attempts were made both upstream and downstream
to wade across, but nobody succeeded in doing
it, and no better luck attended those who tried to make
a bridge by felling a tree across the river, the bridge
was at once swept away. As a last expedient a large
reward of money was offered to the first man who
should find a way across the river, and again they all
set out full of hope and armed with axes. The luck
fell to two of the Gurkhas, who cleverly felled a large
tree straight across the river. Had it fallen a few feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
to one side or the other it would not have been long
enough to reach the other bank, and if it had bent a little
more in the middle, the water would have snatched it
up like a straw and carried it away in a moment. But
it kept just clear above the water and made a safe
temporary bridge by which they could cross, and before
nightfall a single rope of rattan was securely tied across
the narrowest part of the river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RATTAN BRIDGE</div>

<p>During the night the river rose and carried away
the tree, and it seemed that with only one strand of
rattan across the river the prospect of our reaching the
other side was not very good. Nobody seemed inclined
to risk the passage, even with the promise of a large
reward, until one of the Gurkhas, Jangbir by name,
said he would go. “There was only one way to go
over—hand over hand, with a rattan round his
waist held by us in case the bridge strand broke, a
very likely thing, for it was extremely flimsy. Again
the rope to hold him had to be very thin, or the
weight would tear him from his hold. He got across
finely, being dragged out straight by the torrent,
until nearly over, when he could make no more
headway. The rope tied to his waist was paid out
fast, but was caught by the current, and then it was
touch and go. Thus he hung for half a minute,
dragged out in a horizontal position. If both rattans
gave, it meant certain death; if he let go, the great
strain would snap the rope round him with a like
result. The rope was pulled in as quickly as possible,
and then the lucky thing occurred. The strain was
too great, and the rope we were pulling on snapped.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>This freed him, and he pulled himself up further and
gained the bank.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p234.jpg" width="500" height="309" alt="BRIDGE MADE BY THE EXPEDITION ACROSS THE IWAKA RIVER." />
<p class="caption">BRIDGE MADE BY THE EXPEDITION ACROSS THE IWAKA RIVER.</p></div>

<p>When once a man was on the other side, it was
simple to throw over another rattan, and so to pull
over many more which he tied to the trees on his bank.
On our side of the river was a large boulder with a hole
conveniently bored through it, into which stout posts
were jammed Y-fashion, and over them the rattans were
strained and fastened to the trees behind. When more
men were able to cross the river, a similar structure was
erected on the other bank.</p>

<p>The plan of the bridge was very simple, two hand-rails
made of a number of twisted rattans, and a foot
piece made of a long thin tree, which was secured to the
hand-rails by loops of rattan. The span of the bridge
was about one hundred feet, and there must have been
several hundred yards of rattan used in its construction.
The credit of the idea and of most of the work in making
the bridge is due to the Gurkhas, without whose help
we should never have crossed the Iwaka.</p>

<p>But all this work had occupied valuable time, and
when the bridge was finished we found that we had
provisions left for only eight days longer. On
February 8th Rawling, Marshall and I, with three
Gurkhas and nineteen coolies, and Cramer with a small
party of convicts, crossed the Iwaka and made a way
Eastwards. After crossing a moderately steep ridge
we came down to a stream of marvellously clear water,
which brought us in a short time to another large river
flowing out of the mountains in a Southerly direction.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>
<p>So many rivers are there in this region that this was
in some places separated by less than two miles from the
Iwaka; it was eventually found that this was a branch
of the Wania, a large river which enters the sea in a
common mouth with the Kamura, of which the Iwaka
is a tributary. It was evident that this river came from
the slopes of Mount Godman (9,500 ft.) a huge mass
immediately to the North of us, and it was our intention
to climb up on to the ridge of that mountain in the
hopes of obtaining a view of the country to the North
of it, and of the Snow Mountains.</p>

<p>Going up the valley we found ourselves in the midst
of really beautiful scenery. The mountains soon closed
in about us, and the river, though not running through
an actual gorge, was walled by precipices of white limestone
rock, now on one side and now on the other.
This necessitated our frequently crossing the river, a
task by no means easy even when the water is low, as
it happened to be at that time. The best way of crossing
those rapid rivers is not to fight your way upwards
and across the stream, but to go rather with the stream
in a sloping direction towards the other bank, and to
go as quickly as may be. The bottom is made of very
slippery stones, and a false step means disaster, as we
all found at different times, but in that way you cross
with far less exertion than by breasting the stream.</p>

<p>In this valley, for the first time since we came to
New Guinea, we found several flowering plants; among
the rocks by the river grew clumps of a large pink Balsam,
and on the moss at the foot of the tree trunks was a
beautiful scarlet <i>Begonia</i> with a remarkably hairy leaf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>There was a curious green-flowered aroid with a large
blotched leaf, and growing everywhere over the cliffs
and the tree trunks were Pitcher plants (<i>Nepenthes</i>) of
two species.</p>

<p>On the second day we camped on a sort of shelf
on the hillside, two or three hundred feet above the
river, and as our progress up the valley had been so
slow, it was certain that we should not be able to reach
the summit ridge before we were obliged to turn back
by lack of food. So it was decided to go straight up the
spur on which we then were in the hope that from the
top we might see a view of the surrounding country.
On the following day we climbed up about two
thousand feet; the hillside was exceedingly steep, and
the men had to haul themselves up by the roots of the
trees above them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LACK OF WATER</div>

<p>At our camp on the hillside—there was not a square
yard of level ground—we were troubled for the first time
in New Guinea by a lack of water. No rain had fallen
for two days, and the ground was so steep that all the
water had run off, and it was a long time before the
Gurkhas found a trickle of water in a gully some
distance away, whence a supply was laboriously fetched
to the camp.</p>

<p>On the fourth day we climbed up about two
thousand feet further, but with a great deal more difficulty.
The trees became smaller as we went up, but
infinitely denser, and for a great part of the way we
scrambled up, not along the ground, but over a
fantastic network of roots and trunks of dead and living
trees, all of them covered with mosses and festooned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
with a wonderful variety of creepers. In some places
we were clambering over the topmost branches of the
tangle of vegetation, and in others we were burrowing
into mossy caves and grottoes among the roots. It was
a weird and rather uncanny place and, except that it
lacked the beauty of colour that is found there, it
recalled the forest at ten thousand feet in Ruwenzori
more than any other place I have seen.</p>

<p>At 5,000 feet we found ourselves on the ridge, a
narrow knife-edged spur of Mount Godman, and there
we camped. It was a most unlikely looking spot for a
camp, but the ridge beyond was a great deal worse—it
took the Gurkhas many hours to cut the narrowest
track along it for half a mile—so we had to make the
best of the place that we had reached. A number of
trees were cut down and the irregularities of the ground
were more or less filled up with the branches, and
there we pitched our tents and spread our beds. There
was a small shrub (a species of <i>Erica</i>, I think), which,
when burnt, filled the air with a delicious smell of
incense, strangely out of keeping with our surroundings.</p>

<p>Though we had been surrounded by dense clouds
since we reached the ridge, it obstinately refused to
rain for the third day in succession, a thing quite unprecedented
in our experience of the country. Happily
the mosses, which clothed everything, were full of
moisture and we had only to squeeze them like sponges
to get water in plenty; the coolies of course complained
of the dirty colour of their rice when it was cooked in
mossy water, but we found that it gave to ours an unfamiliar
and not unpleasant taste.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A WIDE VIEW</div>

<p>The greater part of the next day was spent in cutting
a way along the ridge to a point (5800 ft.) from which
it was hoped that a view of the country might be seen.
Long before the track was cut the clouds were down
upon us, and no view could be seen, so we decided to
stay for another day, although we had only one day’s
food remaining. But the view that we saw on the
following day was more than compensation for our
rather scanty fare.</p>

<p>Due North of us, and rising from the spur on which
we stood, was the great mass of Mount Godman, and
to the West of that the even more imposing peak of
Wataikwa Mountain (9923 ft.). Between the two
could be seen a part of the tremendous cliffs of Mount
Leonard Darwin (13,882), the southern face of which
appears to show an almost vertical precipice of upwards
of ten thousand feet. To the West ridge beyond ridge
of forest-covered heights stretched away to the ranges
of the Charles Louis Mountains in the far distance.
To the East rose the beautiful three-topped mountain
called the Cock’s Comb (10,050 ft.), behind and to the
North of which heavy banks of clouds showed where
the snows of Mount Carstensz lay hidden. Five thousand
feet below us the mountains ended almost abruptly,
and the southern half of the circuit of our view was
occupied by the hideous plain of dull green jungle to a
hazy line of the sea forty miles away. Here and there
the sunlight caught the waters of innumerable rivers,
and we could distinctly see those that we had crossed,
the Tuaba, Kamura, Wataikwa, and the Iwaka. Further
to the East was a still bigger river, the Wania, which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
could trace down to its lagoon-like estuary, and beyond
it was the Aiika, and a very distant river, possibly the
Newerip.</p>

<p>Nobody who has not spent a year and more in a
dreary jungle country, where you are seldom more
than a yard or two from the nearest tree, and where the
limit of your view is the opposite bank of a stagnant
river, can realise the rest, to the mind and to the eye
alike, that a wide horizon gives. Although there were
points of interest to be seen by the cartographical eye,
there was nothing, excepting the outlines of some of
the nearer mountains, of beauty in that view; there
were no striking features of the land and no gorgeous
effects of colour, but one will always treasure a recollection
of the physical delight of seeing far and wide
to the horizon, and of the feeling of satisfaction in looking
down godlike on the world that we had so painfully
traversed.</p>

<p>But views, like all other good things, have their
ends, and ours was all too soon interrupted by the daily
thick blanket of white cloud, which rolled up and enveloped
us until nightfall. We groped our way back
to the camp where we found our coolies very miserable
and shivering with cold—poor wretches, they had
never before endured, nor even imagined, a temperature
so low as 50° F. To us the coolness was very pleasant,
and it provoked a hunger to which we had long been
strangers; very small quantities of boiled rice, and
<i>chupatties</i> made by the Gurkhas of mildewed and
weevilly flour, only served to stimulate our appetites
for more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">RARE BIRDS</div>

<p>On the following day we retreated hastily downhill
by the way we had come, and by forced marches,
perhaps a little accelerated by our lack of food, in two
days we arrived at the Iwaka camp. In the meantime
Grant had been camped with the two Dayak collectors
on a hill about three thousand feet high above the Iwaka,
where they had made a very fine collection of birds.
Among them was a new dwarf species of Cassowary
(<i>Casuarius claudi</i>) and specimens of the rare Six-plumed
Bird of Paradise (<i>Parotia meeki</i>). Another
bird very characteristic of the Iwaka and neighbouring
valleys is the Moustached Swift (<i>Macropteryx mystacea</i>),
which measures more than two feet across the wings,
and is remarkable for its long pointed tail and its
tapering white moustache. This bird seldom appears
until late in the afternoon, when it is seen sailing
majestically with outstretched wings at a height over
the river.</p>

<p>Near the Iwaka on a hillside laid bare by a landslip
we found two seams of coal a few inches in thickness;
it was poor stuff and only burnt with difficulty
when put into a fire. Mr. Lorentz found combustible
coal in the hills near Mount Wilhelmina, and it is
probable that a careful search would reveal the existence
of better coal in this region too. Near the same place,
as well as in one or two other localities, we found indications
of petroleum, but all our searches for gold and
other precious metals resulted in nothing except
occasional traces of copper.</p>

<p>During the following days, while we were stumbling
back to Parimau along the now familiar track, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
wondered whether we should be the last as well as being
the first Europeans to penetrate into that forsaken
region. It has been mapped now, and our wanderings
have shown that it is not the way by which any sane
person would go who wished to explore the Snow Mountains.
It is a region absolutely without inhabitants,
and the Papuans, who live on the upper waters of the
Mimika and Kamura rivers, shun it even as a hunting
ground. There are no precious metals or other products
of the soil to be won, and not until all the other
forests in the world are cut down will its timber be of
value. So it may safely be supposed that it will long
be left untouched; the Birds of Paradise will call by
day, the cassowaries will boom by night, and the leeches
will stretch themselves anxiously on their leaves, but it
will be a long time before another white man comes to
disturb them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DREARY JUNGLE</div>

<p>Many people have the idea that a tropical forest is
full of gorgeous flowers, about which brilliant butterflies
are constantly flitting and birds of splendid plumage
flash from tree to tree. This idea is no doubt due in a
great measure to the habit of gathering together in hothouses
the flowering plants of all the Tropics, though
they may have come from Central America, from Africa
and from Borneo or Java. It is true that there are
many splendid birds, but the vegetation is so dense
that you seldom, if ever, see them; the brilliant butterflies
are mostly out of sight near the topmost branches
of the trees; and you may travel for days together
without seeing a single flowering plant. Many of the
trees are covered with orchids on all their branches, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>they very seldom flower, and the flowers of most of them
are so insignificant that they do not attract your
attention.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p242.jpg" width="400" height="642" alt="THE SUPPORTS OF A PANDANUS (30 FEET HIGH)." />
<p class="caption">THE SUPPORTS OF A PANDANUS (30 FEET HIGH).</p></div>

<p>Occasionally you may see high above your head
the white flower of a <i>Dendrobium</i> or the long spike of
the gigantic <i>Grammatophyllum</i>, but I have only once
(in a small island on the North coast of New Guinea)
seen such a mass of flowering orchids as to make a splash
of colour in the view. In the Tropics there is nothing
comparable in colour with the blue hyacinths, the fields
of buttercups, or the gorse and hawthorns of this
country.</p>

<p>But if there is little that is beautiful in the jungle
vegetation, there is a great deal that is curious and
interesting. The ubiquitous Rattans, climbing Palms,
are a constant source of wonder for their snake-like
meanderings through the jungle until they climb to
the top of some tree where they end in a bunch of leaves.
We found three species of Screw Pines (<i>Pandanus</i>),
fantastic trees on stilts, and branching like irregular
candelabra. The wood of the <i>Pandanus</i> is very tough,
and is used by the natives for making bows and spears;
the long ribbon-like leaves are used for mats and the
walls of their huts, and the fruits of some are eatable,
but exceedingly hard. One species bears a cluster of
small red fruit about the size of a banana; and another
bears a huge melon-shaped fruit of a brilliant scarlet
colour and weighing as much as thirty pounds and
upwards.</p>

<p>Equally remarkable are the trees which stand
propped on a number of aerial roots and seem, as Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
Wallace noted,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> to have started growing in mid air;
where several of these trees grow together, it is difficult
to say where one ends and another begins. Too rarely
you come across a magnificent forest tree (usually, I
believe, a species of <i>Dammara</i>) supported on huge
buttresses, which begin twenty or more feet above the
ground and spread out for many yards from the foot
of the tree. We had occasion to cut down some of
these trees, and found the wood intensely hard; if there
were seven or eight buttresses a single one would still
hold up the tree after all the rest had been cut. When
the tree had been felled, the stump looked like a great
starfish sprawling over the ground with a centre not
more than a foot across, while the trunk a few feet
up had been a yard or more in thickness.</p>

<p>It has happened to me to walk through many
hundreds of miles of forest in different parts of the
world, but I have never seen any so dreary as that
New Guinea jungle with its mud, its leeches, its almost
unbroken stillness, and its universal air of death.
Happily the mind of man is of a curiously selective
habit, and it chooses to retain only the more pleasant
things; you forget the long wet weeks of rain and mud,
the hunger and the nasty food, and remember rather
those glorious moments when you came out of the
twilit jungle into an open river bed and saw the distant
mountains, or those rare sunny afternoons when the
“implacable cicala” creaked in the treetops above
your tent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FUTURE TRAVELLERS</div>

<p>There are indeed a thousand things to interest one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>in the jungle, however blank and monotonous it may
seem to be. The trouble is that so much of your attention
in these places must be devoted to the trivial duties
of the day, the eternal question of food, the care of
the sick, the precautions against floods, and so on, that
but little time is left over for studying the hidden wonders
of the world about you. The geographers and the
naturalists of the future will live in comfortable ships
on the coast, whence they will fly daily into the heart
of New Guinea where they will find things undreamt
of now. But the time for that is not yet, and in the
meantime those who plod on foot do the best they can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> our return to Parimau in February, Rawling and
Grant went down to Wakatimi, while Marshall and I
spent a week in visiting the village of the Tapiro in
a last but vain attempt to see the pygmy women. The
first few days of March were occupied in packing up
the accumulated odds and ends of our year’s occupation
and on the 9th of March we were ready to depart.
We had told the natives that we were going away and
for days before we went they pestered us with questions
as to whether we were coming back and what we would
give them when we went, and they quickly decided
which of our houses they intended to occupy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p246.jpg" width="400" height="633" alt="BUTTRESSED TREES." />
<p class="caption">BUTTRESSED TREES.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">PARTING WITH THE NATIVES</div>

<p>On the morning of our departure from Parimau
we allowed no natives to come into the camp until all
the canoes were loaded up and ready for a start.
Then we called out to them to come over and about
forty men and boys splashed across the river and came
swarming into the camp. We had kept for them a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>number of axe-heads, knives and other pieces of steel
and iron, and when the people saw what they were
going to be given they became a crowd of madmen.
I distributed the things, while Marshall stood by with
a big piece of wood and kept them from rushing into the
place and seizing everything at once. They shouted
and raved and screamed and grew almost pale with
excitement, and the various expressions of greed and
cunning and anger and delight in their faces were most
interesting to watch.</p>

<p>After we had given them their presents we walked
towards the canoes, and then they began to set up their
horrible wail. A few of them picked up pieces of cloth
and matting, through the middle of which they thrust
their heads and then began to howl with their hands
over their eyes. I took a last look round the houses
to see that nothing of value had been left behind and on
going to the store-house I met a man, one of our best
friends, coming out of it with a tin of rice under his
arm. He immediately put down the tin, tore off from
a climbing bean that grew by the house a trail of
leaves a yard or two long, and wound them about his
head and body. Then he burst into tears and the
most heartrending sobs, which changed in a moment,
when he caught my eye, into a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>When we finally got into the canoes all the men
came down to the water’s edge and wailed, while some
of them sat down in the water and smeared themselves
with mud. In the meantime we could see their
women going off into the jungle carrying tins full of
their possessions to hide there, and it is probable that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
after we left there was a good deal of quarrelling and
fighting over the spoil. The wailing is a purely perfunctory
politeness, but I think there were a few men
who were genuinely sorry to lose us. On the following
day a strong ebb-tide bore us quickly down to Wakatimi
and our navigations of the upper Mimika river
were at an end.</p>

<p>In the meantime Rawling had made an interesting
exploration of the coast and of the river mouths to the
East of the Mimika. The motor boat, which had been
badly damaged some months earlier, had been repaired
by two Dutch pioneer soldiers and was more or less
sea-worthy. In a four days’ trip he had entered the
Atuka river, or rather the Atuka mouth of the Kamura
river, a few miles up which he came to Atuka, a
large village of about six hundred huts surrounded
by coconut palms and tobacco plantations. Proceeding
up the river into the main Kamura river he went
on almost to the junction with the Wataikwa river,
thus filling in a large gap of unknown river. On his
way back he chose the left (East) branch and after
passing the village of Kamura, where the inhabitants
showed an inclination to plunder the boat, he came
to the lake-like estuary of the Kamura and Wania
rivers and entered the sea by a deep channel. It is
worth noting that the inhabitants of Atuka and Kamura
villages, many of whom visited us two or three
times at Wakatimi, are of a decidedly lower type (in
appearance) than the people of the Mimika district,
though the distance that separates them is only a few
miles. They have a fiercer and more brutal aspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and many of them, both men and women go completely
naked, a habit which is never practised by the people
of Wakatimi. Scarcity of petrol and an irregularly
sparking plug brought that excursion to an untimely
end, before the lower waters of the Wania had been
investigated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO THE WANIA</div>

<p>From our hill-top (see p. 239) the Wania was
evidently by far the most considerable of all the rivers
of the district, and apart from our desire to see the
people of the Wania, of whom the Mimika natives
always spoke with great respect, we felt bound to
explore that river as far as possible. Accordingly on
March 14, Rawling, Marshall and I, with a Dutch
pioneer, two Gurkhas and three coolies, set off in the
motor boat towing the yawl, a ship’s boat about
twenty feet long, laden with tents and provisions for
a week. In a few hours we arrived at the mouth of
the Wania river and found that owing to the low tide
there was no way of crossing the sand-bar that lay
across the entrance. This circumstance was the more
remarkable, because only a few days earlier Rawling
had come through this bar by a very deep channel.
The frequent changes in the banks make the navigation
of this coast and particularly of the river mouths
exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>On this occasion the sea was already rather rough,
so that we could not anchor and wait until the tide
rose, and as the wind was increasing in force there
was nothing for it but to turn back and try to take
shelter in one of the rivers between the Wania and the
Mimika, if not in the Mimika itself. All went well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
for a few miles and then, as happened frequently, the
leather band jumped off the driving wheel and the
engine was stopped. When it was replaced and the
engine was started again, there was no churning of
water in the stern and we realized with some consternation
that we had lost our propeller. We were about
twelve miles from the mouth of the Mimika, in a
shallow sea of less than three fathoms, with a strong
wind blowing towards the shore where the waves began
to break within a few hundred yards of us, and we
were ten men with a heavy motor boat and a heavily-laden
yawl to get along somehow. We put four men
into the yawl to row and they tried to tow, but the
current was so strong against them that they made
no headway at all, so we had to anchor where we were
and hoped for better things. We pitched and rolled
and bumped about most horribly and soon most of the
party were deadly sea-sick, perhaps luckily for them,
because in that condition one cares nothing for the
prospect of shipwreck.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_p250.jpg" width="400" height="597" alt="SCREW PINES." />
<p class="caption">SCREW PINES (<i>Pandanus</i>).</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE</div>

<p>Our anchor rope was short and none too strong,
and the rope between us and the yawl was thoroughly
rotten—it had snapped once earlier in the day—and
we expected that every sudden jerk of the lumpy sea
would break it again. Had that happened, there
might have been a nasty accident, as the men were
too sick to row, even if they had known the art, and
their chances of swimming ashore through a sea swarming
with sharks were not very bright. Our own predicament
in the helpless motor boat would have been unpleasant
too, if the yawl had gone adrift, but happily the ropes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>held. Another drawback was that the motor boat
leaked like a sieve, so that a man was kept constantly
at work baling her out, and we did not know that the
strain might not open her old timbers even more.
There was a glorious full moon which one would have
enjoyed seeing from the smooth deck of a steamer,
but there we could only think how uncomfortable it
was lying (without having had dinner) on boxes and
tins and gear of all sorts huddled in the bottom of the
boat.</p>

<p>The wind continued all through the night and the
sea did not moderate, so at daylight, after having been
for sixteen hours at anchor, we decided to leave the
motor boat hoping that it would not be swamped before
we were able to come back and fetch it. We all got
into the yawl, which we pulled through quite a nasty
sea for about three miles to a sand-bank in the estuary
of the Timura river, where we camped until the rising
tide enabled us to reach the mainland about midnight.
On the following day, the sea having become calmer,
we rescued the motor boat, which was by that time
half full of water, and towed it slowly to the Timura.</p>

<p>But it was a most arduous business and without the
help of a party of natives, who fortunately came along
the coast in canoes and were prevailed upon to assist
us in paddling, we should never have been able to
bring back both of the boats. The arrival of the motor
boat at the Mimika on the fifth day, propelled by native
paddles instead of by its own power, was not a very
dignified affair—it resembled rather the formerly familiar
sight of the motor-car in tow of a horse from the plough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
—but it was a piece of good fortune that it and we
returned at all.</p>

<p>We stopped for a night on the way at Nimé, a village
at the mouth of the Keaukwa River. This is a very
large village—I counted four hundred and thirty huts—but
there were hardly a dozen people in the place,
the whole population having gone off on one of their
periodical migrations to a vegetable diet up the river.
It was evident from the immense piles of fishbones and
empty shells about the houses that the inhabitants must
live largely by fishing, when they are there. The houses
are better made than those at Wakatimi, and they are
arranged in terraces and crescents along the water’s
edge. It was there that we saw the elaborate dancing-houses
described above (p. <a href="#Page_143">143</a>).</p>

<p>Just as we paddled laboriously into the Mimika
estuary we saw far down on the horizon the smoke of
a steamer, and in an hour or two a white painted vessel,
which turned out to be the Dutch Government ship
<i>Zwaan</i>, drew inshore and anchored outside the bar.
We naturally supposed that this was a ship that had
come to take away the expedition, as we had informed
the Government some months earlier that we hoped to
be ready to leave the country by the end of March.
But that communication had taken a long time, as
everything does in those regions, in reaching its destination,
and the <i>Zwaan</i> had come, not to take away
the expedition, but to bring the means of prolonging
the expedition still further.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p252.jpg" width="500" height="362" alt="AT SUMBAWA PESAR." />
<p class="caption">AT SUMBAWA PESAR.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">LATE ARRIVAL OF DAYAKS</div>

<p>It appeared that in the previous December the Committee
of the Expedition at home, hearing of our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>scarcity of coolies some months earlier, had decided
that a further supply of coolies should be sent to us
without delay. Though cables work quickly enough
between London and Singapore, communications beyond
that are matters of days and weeks, and it was not until
the 18th of March that the party of Dayak coolies,
who had been engaged in Sarawak by the kind permission
of H.H. the Raja, arrived at the Mimika. They
were in the charge of Mr. C. B. Kloss, Curator of the
Government Museum at Kuala Lumpor, who had
brought with him six months’ provision for himself and
the men. Almost at the same time that the Committee
in England had taken this step, we in New Guinea
had decided that three months more was as long as
we were prepared to stay in the country, and a request
had been sent to the Dutch Government to take us
away at the end of that time.</p>

<p>When the <i>Zwaan</i> arrived we were all ready to
depart, and Cramer’s party, numbering more than a
hundred men, were chafing with impatience to get
away; it would have been impossible for the Government
to keep them there yet another six months. Even
if there had been a possibility of our staying on in the
country, the number of Dayaks, thirty-eight, was
quite insufficient for a long journey into the interior
and the prospect of reaching the moderately high
ground of Tapiro Mountain, the best that could be
hoped for, was not sufficient inducement to tempt any
one to paddle again up the Mimika river. Added to
this was the further consideration that in a week or
two the more rainy season would begin and that for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
five or six months very little progress would be possible
even with an unlimited supply of the best coolies.</p>

<p>So there was nothing for it but for Mr. Kloss and
the Dayaks to go back in the <i>Zwaan</i>, which sailed for
Amboina on the following day, taking also Marshall,
as many sick and useless coolies and soldiers as could
be crammed on board, and an urgent request to the
authorities to remove us as soon as might be. The
Dayak episode was altogether an unfortunate one;
had the men reached us six months earlier, we should
have made a very good use of them, few though they
were; but coming as they did when we were on the
point of leaving the country they merely illustrated
the uselessness of attempting to conduct an expedition
from the other side of the world.</p>

<p>During the next three weeks we waited for the
ship with what patience we could. By that time we
were all somewhat stale and disinclined for any exertion,
and those days of waiting at Wakatimi seemed
interminably long. The only pleasant moments were
when on fine evenings we could sit outside and watch
the sun go down behind the palm trees across the
river and hope each time that that would be the last.
There were times when for two or three days a strong
wind blew and we could hear the surf thundering on
the beach, and we knew that even if the ship came it
could not approach the shore. Then there were false
alarms of whistles having been heard, or of boats seen
coming up the river, but our suspense at last came to
an end on April 5th, when a steam-launch towing a
string of empty boats came puffing up to the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
where they were received with immense enthusiasm.
They came from the Dutch gunboat <i>Mataram</i>, which had
been despatched to take away the native escort, and
the next day came boats from the <i>Zwaan</i>, which had
come to transport us and our men and the remaining
stores of the expedition to Amboina. There followed
two days of busy loading and coming and going of boats,
during which our impatience to be off was a little
allayed by the forethought of one of the officers of
the <i>Mataram</i>, who stayed ashore with us and had brought
with him that rare luxury, bread, and one or two
other welcome delicacies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DEPARTURE FROM WAKATIMI</div>

<p>Before sunset on April 7th the last boat was loaded
and ready to go, and we had an amusing leave-taking
with the people of Wakatimi. It was known that
we were going to depart and for some days people from
other villages had been crowding into Wakatimi. A
large number of men were waiting outside the fence
of the camp, but when we invited them to come inside
they became unaccountably shy and would not venture.
So I went outside and took one bolder fellow, a man
whom we knew well, and led him by the arm to a hut,
where there were a quantity of old mosquito nets; he
seized one and bolted as fast as he could run, apparently
thinking that there was something suspicious in this
unwonted generosity. Then a few more came very
warily after him and then fifty or sixty men dashed
into the house and out again as soon as they had
snatched up something, it mattered not what. Most of
them were armed with spears or bows and arrows, and
as there were men fighting to get into and out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
house at the same time it was wonderful that nobody
was damaged.</p>

<p>When the people in Wakatimi saw what was going
on in the camp they began to yell with excitement,
and in a few seconds twenty or more canoes packed
with men came paddling madly across the river; they
were so excited that some of them upset the canoes, a
thing they very seldom do, and they had to swim to
the shore. For ten minutes or so the camp was a
pandemonium. About two hundred raving lunatics were
dashing madly from one house to another and carrying
off boxes, sacks, mosquito nets, cases of empty bottles,
bits of iron, tables, beds, mats and everything they
could possibly move. They howled and raved and
fought like wild beasts in a manner horrible to see.</p>

<p>Several women came over and danced and sang in
a canoe just in front of the camp, while the crowd of
people who had not been able to find a place in the
canoes shrieked from the opposite bank.  When they
could carry no more, they loaded their canoes to the
brim with miscellaneous cargoes and went back across
the river to the village. There they at once began
to squabble over the spoils, and the last we heard of
Wakatimi, as darkness came down, were the shrill
shrieks of quarrelsome women and the angry shouts
of men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAST OF NEW GUINEA</div>

<p>New Guinea treated us kindly in farewell, and we
steamed down the river in a glorious starlight, the
kind of night which many people think is usual in the
tropics, but is in fact most lamentably rare. We left
Cramer on board the <i>Mataram</i> and went on to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
<i>Zwaan</i>, where we soon were lulled to sleep by the
pleasant music of the screw. Early the next morning
a dull cloud on the northern horizon was our last view
of New Guinea, and before night we had reached civilisation
again in the anchorage of Dobo.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_p256.jpg" width="500" height="329" alt="NEAR BULELING. ISLAND OF BALI." />
<p class="caption">NEAR BULELING. ISLAND OF BALI.</p></div>

<p>Two days later we came to the Ké Islands and went
ashore to visit the Catholic Mission at Toeal. There is
nothing of great interest to see there except the magnificent
“iron wood” timber, which is cut in the forests
of the larger island, and is used for boat-building; it
is obtained in larger pieces than teak, and it is said to be
equally good. The fathers occupy themselves with
carpentry and boat-building and with teaching a class
of small children. The few people whom we saw
appeared to be of a mixed Malay-Papuan race and were
dressed in unspeakably dirty clothes.</p>

<p>From Toeal we went on to Banda, where we spent
a day of pouring rain, a great pity, for a walk through
the nutmeg woods of Banda is one of the pleasantest
excursions in the islands, and a day later we dropped
anchor in the harbour of Amboina.</p>

<p>It will be fitting to remark here that on the
outward journey from Java to New Guinea and on our
return from the Mimika to Amboina, the members of
the expedition were the guests of the Netherlands
Government. The thanks of the Secretary of State
for Foreign Affairs have been conveyed to the captains
of the ships and to the other officials, who helped the
expedition in a hundred different ways.</p>

<p>At Amboina, where we waited a few days for the
arrival of a steamer to Singapore, we parted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Cramer, who was prevented by a sharp attack of fever
from coming with us. He was the one other man,
beside Rawling, Marshall and myself, who remained
with the expedition from the beginning to the end,
and it is not paying him an empty compliment to
say that few other people would have managed more
successfully than he did to live with a party of foreigners
in circumstances, which were often exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p>We sailed from Amboina on April 17th in the mail
steamer <i>Van Riebeeck</i>, and amongst our fellow-passengers
we found Captain Van der Bie and Lieut. Van der
Wenn (Netherlands Navy), both of whom were returning
to Java invalided from the expedition to the
Island River in New Guinea. The expedition had
penetrated a long way into the interior of the country,
but all the Europeans fell ill and the expedition was
withdrawn a few months later.</p>

<p>After calling at Macassar we went South past the
Postilion Islands to the little known island of Sumbawa,
where we went ashore for a few hours at Sumbawa
Pesar. It looked a pretty country with well-wooded
hills and level cultivated plains. We were much struck
by the appearance of the natives, who have a longer
type of face and a much fairer skin than any other of
the Malay races I have seen. The men all go armed
with a <i>kris</i>, and they smoke cigars of an incredible
length.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISLAND OF BALI</div>

<p>From Sumbawa we steamed along the Northern
shore of Lombok, from whose Peak (12,000 feet), the
clouds rolled off magnificently at sunset, and early
the next morning we came into the harbour of Buleling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
in the island of Bali. There we took a native carriage
(<i>sado</i>), and drove a few miles out into the country to
see a very interesting Hindu temple, where there are
some remarkable good stone carvings, which shew
signs of being carefully tended. The Hindu religion
still survives, though it cannot be said to flourish, both
in this island and in Lombok. The native villages
that we saw have quite characteristic features of their
own; they are surrounded by a high mud wall with
a brick coping and are guarded by a swarm of fiercely
barking dogs. Inside the wall, if you are bold enough
to enter, you find a neatly swept compound, round the
sides of which are well-made dwelling-houses, and in
the middle are granaries of rice; both the houses and
the granaries are raised on posts several feet above
the ground and all are neatly thatched with rice straw.
In the corner of the compound is a place set apart for
a number of little stone shrines, some of them very
elaborately carved, in which votive offerings of flowers
and fruit are placed.</p>

<p>The Balinese seem to be a sturdy and industrious
people; they have a free and independent appearance,
very different from that of their somewhat grovelling
neighbours, the Javanese. The roads are picturesquely
lined with shady trees, and a very pleasant feature of
them is the number of little mouse-coloured ponies,
which carry panniers on a high-peaked saddle and are
the coolies of Bali; most of them have an elaborate
leather harness and many carry a large number of
little bells, which make a pretty music along the roads.
They appear to be hungry little animals, and they have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
the rare and valuable faculty of being able to eat out of
a basket tied round their necks as they walk along.
The country, what little we saw of it, looks extremely
prosperous, and the beauty of the cultivated lands,
interrupted here and there by groves of trees and
backed by mountains, is beyond dispute.</p>

<p>From Bali to Java is only a few hours’ steaming,
and from Batavia another ship brought us to Singapore,
where we arrived on May 2nd. A month later we
landed in England and the English Expedition to
Dutch New Guinea, 1910-11, was a thing of the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE END</div>

<p>It is not easy to put down in words what were our
thoughts on our homeward journey from the Mimika
River to Plymouth Sound. Naturally enough there
were feelings of pleasant anticipation in returning to
the comforts of civilised life, and there were feelings
of profound thankfulness that we had left behind us
neither our bones nor our health, as too many others
less fortunate had done. There was also a sense of
(I think pardonable) satisfaction at having accomplished
something; the surveyors had made an accurate map
of a large tract of quite unknown country; the
naturalists had made valuable collections of birds and
animals, and some most interesting races of men had
been visited and studied.</p>

<p>But beneath these was another feeling of vague
disappointment. We had set out full of hope, if not
of confidence, of reaching the Snow Mountains, and
the disappointment of not having set foot on them
was aggravated by the fact that we had been so long
in sight of them. It was exasperating beyond words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
to see the mountains month after month only forty
miles away and not to be able to move a foot in their
direction; to study them so that we came to know
the changing patches of lower snow and almost the
very crevasses in the glaciers, and still to be forced
to be content with looking and longing for “the hills
and the snow upon the hills.”</p>

<p>To look for fifteen months at that great rock precipice,
and those long fields of snow untrodden yet by
foot of man, to anticipate the delight of attaining to
the summits and to wonder what would be seen beyond
them on the other side, those were pleasures that kept
one’s hopes alive through long periods of dull inaction.
The aching disappointment of turning back and leaving
the mountains as remote and as mysterious as they
were before words of mine cannot express; but happily
there is always comfort to be found in the reflexion
that</p>

<h2>APPENDIX A</h2>

<p class="center">NOTES ON THE BIRDS COLLECTED; BY THE B.O.U.
EXPEDITION TO DUTCH NEW GUINEA</p>

<p class="center f09"><span class="smcap">By W. R. OGILVIE-GRANT</span></p>

<p>Our knowledge of the Birds of New Guinea is based
mainly on Count T. Salvadori’s monumental work <i>Ornitologia
della Papuasia e delle Molluche</i>, which appeared
in three large volumes in 1880-82, and on his <i>Aggiunte</i>
to the above work published in three parts in 1887-89.
Since that date our knowledge of the avi-fauna has
vastly increased and a very large number of splendid
Birds-of-Paradise and other remarkable new species have
been discovered.</p>

<p>A list of the principal works subsequently published,
placed in chronological order, will be found at the end of
this chapter, the most important papers being no doubt
those by the Hon. Walter Rothschild and Dr. E. Hartert,
which have appeared from time to time in the Tring
Museum periodical <i>Novitates Zoologicæ</i>. Mr. Rothschild
is to be congratulated on the success which has
attended the efforts of his various collectors in New
Guinea and on the energy which he has displayed in
obtaining birds from unknown districts of the most
interesting island in the world.</p>

<p>To give in a single chapter a brief and partly scientific,
partly popular, summary of the ornithological work
accomplished by our Expedition in Dutch New Guinea is
a more difficult task than might be imagined, for there
is not only an immense number of species to be dealt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
with, but in most instances very little is known about
their habits. The jungles of South-western New Guinea
are so dense that white men can scarcely traverse them,
and most of the collecting had to be done by the trained
natives from the Malay Peninsula, kindly supplied by
Mr. H. C. Robinson, and by the Gurkhas who accompanied
the Expedition.</p>

<p>By dealing with each family in turn, I shall endeavour
to refer to all the more important species in the collection
in their proper scientific order, briefly describing
some of the more beautiful, so that those without any
special knowledge of birds may, if they care to do so,
form some idea of the marvellous types which have
been brought home from the interior of South-western
New Guinea.</p>

<p>It is certain that the resources of that wonderful
island are not nearly exhausted: on the contrary, every
fresh collecting expedition sent to the interior produces
remarkable novelties, and large chains of high mountains
are still unexplored. The members of our Expedition
were fortunate in procuring no less than 2,200 skins of
birds in New Guinea, representing about 235 species, of
which ten proved to be new to Science. A number
of new birds were also obtained by the late Mr. Wilfred
Stalker in the mountains of Ceram, which he visited
before joining the main Expedition at Amboina. His
premature death by drowning, a few days after he landed
in New Guinea, was an immense loss to the Expedition,
though his place was ably filled by Mr. Claude Grant,
who worked with his characteristic zeal and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the great bulk of the birds
inhabiting New Guinea belong to a comparatively small
number of families, but that each of these is represented
by a large number of different species, especially in such
groups as the Pigeons, Parrots, Flycatchers, and Honey-eaters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the Pigeons of which no fewer than twenty-seven
different kinds were obtained, it would seem as
though, in some instances at least, Nature had almost
come to the end of her resources in devising new and
wonderful arrangements of colour and markings; for in
some of the smaller Fruit-Pigeons, such as <i>Ptilopus
gestroi</i> and <i>P. zonurus</i> we find two perfectly distinct
species, occurring side by side, possessing almost exactly
the same remarkable scheme of colouration, and only
differing in certain minor points to be found in the
markings of the wing-coverts. Another very similar
instance is to be seen in <i>Ptilopus coronulatus</i> and <i>P. nanus</i>
almost the same colours and pattern being repeated in
both.</p>

<p>The collection obtained by our expedition is a very
valuable one, and has added many new and interesting
forms of bird-life to the incomparable series in the
Natural History Museum, to which the bulk of the
specimens have been presented by the subscribers. A
large proportion of the birds were obtained at low elevations
from sea-level to 2,000 feet, only a comparatively
small number being procured at from 3000-4000 feet.
It is to be regretted that the immense physical difficulties
encountered and other causes prevented our collectors from
reaching a higher zone between 5000 and
10,000 feet, where no doubt much of interest remains to
be discovered by those who are fortunate enough to get
there.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CORVIDAÆ</i>—CROWS.</h3>

<p>Though the true Crows are never brightly coloured
birds, many are extremely handsome, but this epithet
cannot be applied to the Bare-faced Crow (<i>Gymnocorax
senex</i>) which is common on the Mimika River and
distributed over New Guinea generally.</p>

<p>The adult is brownish-black with a slight purplish
or bluish gloss on the wings, but is generally in worn
and shabby plumage. Even when freshly moulted it
is rather a disreputable looking bird, its naked pink
face, pale watery blue eyes, slate-coloured bill and livid
feet adding to its dissipated appearance. Young birds
in their first year’s plumage are even plainer than their
parents, being dull drab-brown inclining to brownish-white
on the head and neck, and appear to be clad
in sackcloth and ashes. They have a weak uncrow-like
call pitched in a high key and their flight is feeble and
seldom sustained.</p>

<p>In addition to this Crow of unprepossessing appearance,
there is a handsome Raven (<i>Corvus orru</i>), much
like our familiar bird but smaller, which was met with
in pairs on the coast.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>PARADISEIDÆ</i>—BIRDS-OF-PARADISE AND
BOWER-BIRDS.</h3>

<p>Closely allied to the well-known Greater Bird-of-Paradise
(<i>Paradisea apoda</i>) from the Aru Islands is the
New Guinea form <i>P. novæ-guineæ</i>, the males being
distinguished by their smaller size and by having the
long ornamental side-plumes of a much richer orange-yellow.
Though the call of this bird was frequently
heard on the upper parts of the Mimika, it was rarely
seen; but on the Wataikwa quite a number were
procured in all stages of plumage. The species was,
however, nowhere plentiful and confined to the foot-hills.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>

<p>The Pygmies often brought plumes of the Lesser
Bird-of-Paradise (<i>P. minor</i>) to Parimau and traded
them with the natives, but the species was not found
on the Mimika, the Charles Louis mountains probably
forming its southern boundary.</p>

<p>My account of the display of that species, as witnessed
in the Zoological Gardens, Regent’s Park, will be found
in the <i>Ibis</i>, 1905, p. 429, accompanied by various
drawings and a coloured plate by Mr. G. E. Lodge. The
display resembles that of the Greater Bird-of-Paradise
(<i>P. apoda</i>) and the Red Bird-of-Paradise (<i>P. raggiana</i>)
and no doubt also that of <i>P. novæ-guineæ</i>. It is a
wonderful and beautiful sight to see these birds erect
their splendid side-plumes in an arch over the back,
which is concealed in a shivering cascade of colour,
orange and white, or red according to the species.</p>

<p>Numbers of the beautiful little King Bird-of-Paradise
(<i>Cicinnurus regius</i>) were brought home in all stages of
plumage from the young to the fully adult male, with
its scarlet head, shading into glittering carmine on the
back and wings and into purplish-carmine on the throat,
which is bordered below by a rich dark green band.
The sides of the chest are ornamented with fan-like
arrangements of grey feathers tipped with glittering
golden green; the breast and the rest of the under-parts
are of the purest white: the outer tail-feathers are
earthy-brown edged with orange-red, while the middle
pair, which cross one another, have the bare shafts
enormously lengthened, and terminate in a tightly
curled disc, golden green above and reddish-brown
beneath.</p>

<p>These beautiful ornaments are seen to the greatest
advantage when the King is displaying, the green-tipped
fan-like feathers on the sides and the white
feathers of the breast being spread out to form a
circular shield in front of the bird, while the green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
metallic discs of the long middle tail-feathers are
erected and waved overhead. An interesting description
of the display of this species is given by Sir William
Ingram in the <i>Ibis</i>, 1907, p. 225, with a coloured
plate and figures drawn by Mr. G. E. Lodge from a
living specimen.</p>

<p>Mr. Walter Goodfellow made an interesting observation
on the habits of this species. While watching some
Pigeons on the opposite bank of the river through his
glasses he saw a small bird rise from the top of a tree
and soar into the air like a Sky-Lark. After it had
risen about 30 feet, it suddenly seemed to collapse and
dropped back into the tree as though it had been shot.
It proved to be a King Bird-of-Paradise and probably
this soaring habit is a part of the display not indulged
in by captive birds confined in comparatively small
cages.</p>

<p>A Rifle-Bird (<i>Ptilorhis magnifica</i>) was fairly common
both on the coast and near the mountains and its call
consisting of two long-drawn notes, one ascending, the
other descending, might be heard at all hours of the day.
Its plumage is mostly velvety black on the head and
upper-parts, but the crown, middle of the throat and
chest, as well as the middle pair of tail-feathers, are
metallic blue and a bronze-green band separates the
chest from the deep purplish-maroon under-parts. The
outer flight feathers are curiously pointed and strongly
falcate and some of the side-feathers terminate in long,
narrow decomposed plumes. The long curved bill and
the legs are black, while the inside of the mouth is pale
apple-green as is the case in several other species of
Paradise-Birds.</p>

<p>Though a well-known species, we must not omit to
mention the splendid Twelve-wired Bird-of-Paradise
(<i>Seleucides niger</i>). The plumage of the male is like dark
brown plush shot with bronze-green on the back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
deep violet on the wings, while the long dark breast-feathers
are edged with rich metallic emerald-green.
The long ornamental side-plumes and the rest of the
under-parts are beautiful bright cinnamon-yellow when
freshly moulted, but this colour is so volatile that it soon
fades to nearly white in skins which have been kept for
a few years. The shafts of six of the long side-plumes
on either side extend far beyond the vane of the feather
and look like twelve recurved wires, hence the bird’s
popular name. The eye is crimson, the bill black, the
gape bright apple-green, and the legs and toes yellowish
flesh-colour.</p>

<p>The Expedition procured three examples of a new
form of <i>Parotia</i> or Six-plumed Paradise-Bird on the
Iwaka River, but unfortunately did not succeed in shooting
a fully adult male. Simultaneously A. S. Meek, who
was collecting for Mr. Rothschild, procured specimens of
the same bird on the Oetakwa River a few miles to the
east, but he likewise did not secure the fully adult male.
The species has been named <i>Parotia carolæ meeki</i> by
Mr. Rothschild.</p>

<p>The plumage of this bird is like brownish-black plush
and equally soft to the touch. The head is ornamented
very wonderfully; on either side behind the eye there
are three long racket-like plumes on long bare shafts, (a
character common to all the members of this remarkable
genus of Paradise-Birds): the middle of the crown is of
a beautiful “old” gold colour in a setting of silvery
white and golden brown: on the occiput there is a
marvellous patch of stiff metal-like feathers, golden-green
bordered with deep violet; the sides of the head
before and behind the eye are golden-brown, the chin
and upper part of the throat deep brown, and the lower
part whitish, spotted with rufous. A lovely metallic
breast-plate of bronze-green and violet feathers with dark
middles covers the chest and the long flank-feathers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
white. The two outer flight feathers are curiously
attenuated near the extremity and terminate in a sharp
point, the shaft bearing only a very narrow web. No
doubt all these ornaments are displayed in a similar
manner to those of <i>P. lawesi</i> from British New Guinea,
males of which have been living for some years in the
Zoological Gardens, Regent’s Park.</p>

<p>Another very handsome species is the Golden-winged
<i>Diphyllodes chrysoptera</i>. The male has the bill and a
bare space behind the eye bluish-white, the inside of the
mouth apple-green and the feet Prussian blue. The
head is clad in short velvety reddish-brown feathers with
two metallic green spots between the eyes; the nape
bears a frill of lengthened brown-tipped plumes; the
mantle is light golden-yellow like spun glass and forms
a lengthened tippet; the inner secondary quills and
shoulder-feathers are orange-yellow, and the back
carmine and dull orange shading into sooty black on the
upper tail-coverts. The throat is deep velvety brown,
the neck and breast rich dark green bordered below
with metallic bluish-green, and with a row of metallic
green bars like steps down the middle of the neck and
chest; the rest of the under-parts are black. The short
outer tail-feathers are sooty brown, while the middle pair
which cross one another are very long and narrow and
of a metallic bluish-green. The female is very soberly
clad, dull brown above and narrowly barred with brown
and buff below.</p>

<p>The Bower-Birds have received their name from their
peculiar habit of constructing bowers or runs where the
males meet to play or pay their court to the females.
The bowers are built long before the birds begin to build
their nests which are placed in trees.</p>

<p>One of the most noteworthy species procured by the
Expedition was the gorgeously coloured Bower-Bird,
<i>Xanthomelus ardens</i>. The male has the eye yellow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the head, sides of the neck and mantle orange-scarlet,
the feathers of the latter being very long and loose and
forming a dense cape; the rest of the plumage is orange-yellow
above and golden-yellow below: the ends of the
quills and the tail-feathers, being black.</p>

<p>The female has the iris brown and is more sombrely
clad, the head and upper-parts, including the wings and
tail, being earthy-brown, while the under-parts, under
wing-coverts and wing-lining, are yellow, like those of
the male, but less bright.</p>

<p>This beautiful species was originally described from
an imperfect native-made skin obtained by the Italian
naturalist, D’Albertis, on the Fly River. Subsequently,
Dr. H. A. Lorentz shot two adult males on the Noord
River, which were described and figured by Dr. Van Oort.
Our expedition was fortunate enough to secure not only
adult males, but also the immature male and adult female,
these latter being hitherto unknown.</p>

<p>The display of the male bird must be a very beautiful
sight, his scarlet cape being no doubt erected, and forming
a great hood over the head.</p>

<p>Among the Bower-Birds, one of the most interesting
was a remarkable female example of a species of <i>Chlamydodera</i>
procured on the Kamura River. Unlike any of
the allied forms, it has the under-surface washed with
yellow, and appears to be the female of <i>C. lauterbachi</i>,
of which the brilliantly coloured male was described by
Dr. Reichenow from an example procured in German
New Guinea.</p>

<p>The male has the crown and sides of the face golden-orange,
the upper-parts olive-brown, edged with yellowish,
and the under-parts bright yellow. It is a very striking
bird and much the most brightly coloured member of the
genus.</p>

<p>Though the two specimens were obtained in localities
so far apart, there seems to be no reason why they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
not be male and female of the same species. The female
obtained by the Expedition possesses many characteristics
in common with the male type of <i>C. lauterbachi</i> and the
differences in plumage are just what one would expect
to find in the female of that species.</p>

<p>The beautiful Cat-bird (<i>Ælurœdus stonei</i>) was fairly
plentiful, and is remarkable on account of its peculiar
colouring. The cap is brown, the back grass-green, and
the neck and under-parts buff, spotted with black, or
green on the longer flank-feathers. The eye is hazel
and the bill and legs slate-blue. The sexes are alike in
plumage. It derives its popular name from its peculiar
hissing alarm note, not unlike the sound made by an
angry cat.</p>

<p>Of the Manucodes, four different kinds were met
with. They are all crow-like birds with brilliant metallic
black plumage glossed with purple, green or blue, and
form a link between the Paradise-Birds and the true
Crows. The Purple-and-Violet Manucode (<i>Phonygama
jamesi</i>) is distinguished by possessing tufts of long,
narrow metallic green plumes behind the eye, and by
having the neck-feathers similarly lengthened; while the
other three belonging to the genus <i>Manucodia</i> have the
head and neck covered with short curly feathers. These
curly-headed species are much alike in general appearance,
but <i>M. orientalis</i> has the short curly feathers on
the chest and breast glittering golden-green, while in
<i>M. jobiensis</i> and <i>M. altera</i> the same parts are dark steel-blue.
<i>Inter se</i> the two latter kinds differ considerably,
both structurally and in colour. <i>M. jobiensis</i> is
smaller and has the feathers of the throat rounded and
crinkled, and the upper-parts glossed with a strong shade
of violet; while <i>M. altera</i> is larger and has the throat-feathers
short but rather pointed, and the general colour
above purplish-blue or steel-blue.</p>

<p>In most of the Manucodes the trachea is very long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and convoluted, that of the Purple-and-Violet species
possessing no fewer than twelve coils which lie between
the skin and the pectoral muscles. In spite of this
marvellous instrument its cries are not nearly so loud
as those of the Birds-of-Paradise of the genus <i>Paradisea</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Claude Grant discovered a nest of <i>M. altera</i> with
two eggs at Parimau, an interesting find, as no properly
authenticated eggs of that species had hitherto been
obtained.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>EULABETIDÆ</i>—TREE-STARLINGS.</h3>

<p>Among the smaller Glossy Starlings we must specially
mention a new species, <i>Calornis mystacea</i>, discovered by the
Expedition. It has the plumage purplish-bronze and is
especially remarkable in having long semi-erect plumes
on the forehead as well as long neck-hackles. Three
specimens were obtained flying in company with large
flocks of <i>C. metallica</i>, a rather widely distributed species,
which ranges to North Australia, the Moluccas and the
Solomon Islands.</p>

<p>The Grackles or Talking Starlings are represented by
two lovely species, the first being the well-known
Dumont’s Grackle (<i>Mino dumonti</i>) a dark glossy greenish-black
bird with a yellow belly and white under tail-coverts.
It has a brown eye surrounded by a large naked orange
patch partially covered with short stiff filaments. The
second species Robertson’s Golden Grackle (<i>Melanopyrrhus
robertsoni</i>) is an equally handsome, but much rarer bird,
and the fine series of adults obtained by the Expedition
proves that it is a species quite distinct from <i>M. orientalis</i>,
the form found in British New Guinea which has a large
black patch on the occiput.</p>

<p>Robertson’s Grackle has the cheeks and upper part of
the throat, as well as the back, wings and breast, black
glossed with green; the rest of the head, neck and chest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
as well as the lower back, rump, upper tail-coverts and
belly, are orange-yellow. In the adult there is no trace
of a black patch on the occiput, but the quite young
bird has the entire crown black and specimens which
have not assumed the fully adult plumage and still
retain some black feathers on the occiput might be
mistaken for <i>M. orientalis</i>. That they have been is
proved by the fact that Count Salvadori and many others
have regarded <i>M. robertsoni</i>, Sharpe, as a synonym of
<i>M. orientalis</i>, Schlegel, but they are really quite distinct.</p>

<p>A few very high trees left standing near the huts at
Wakatimi were the resort, morning and evening, of these
Starlings and various other species of birds. For a long
time during the hot mid-day hours Mr. Goodfellow had
observed that some bird, possessing a remarkably sweet
Thrush-like song, rested there, and, after many days of
watching, he found it to be Robertson’s Golden Grackle.
He says that the notes of this Starling would not pass
unnoticed, even in countries where the birds, as a rule,
have sweeter voices than those inhabiting New Guinea.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>DICRURIDÆ</i>—DRONGOS.</h3>

<p>The Drongos, small Crow-like Flycatchers with
pugnacious habits, are represented in the collection
by two species—<i>Chibia carbonaria</i> and <i>Chælorhynchus
papuensis</i>.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ORIOLIDÆ</i>—ORIOLES.</h3>

<p>The Orioles are represented by one species only,
<i>Mimeta striata</i>, belonging to the dull coloured brown-backed
group with heavily streaked under-parts and the
sexes alike in plumage. It was commonest in the
mangrove swamps near the coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>PLOCEIDÆ</i>—WEAVER-BIRDS.</h3>

<p>This widely distributed group of Weaver-Finches is
not very numerous in New Guinea and the only representative
met with was a small species, <i>Munia tristissima</i>,
which was common in the clearing round the camp at
Wakatimi.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>MOTACILLIDÆ</i>—WAGTAILS.</h3>

<p>The Grey Wagtail (<i>Motacilla melanope</i>) and the Blue-headed
Wagtail (<i>M. flava</i>) were both met with on the
Mimika and other rivers. It is interesting to note that
both species are included in the British List, the former
being a regular breeding-species in our islands. The
birds wintering in far-off New Guinea, no doubt formed
part of the eastern colonies of these species which nest in
Siberia and visit the Indo-Malayan Islands in winter.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>MELIPHAGIDÆ</i>—HONEY-EATERS.</h3>

<p>The Honey-eaters are very numerously represented
in South-western New Guinea and no fewer than twenty-seven
species were met with by our Expedition.</p>

<p>The family is divided in two sections, the first
including the comparatively brightly coloured genus
<i>Myzomela</i> the members of which resemble true Sun-birds
(<i>Nectariniidæ</i>) in general appearance. Seven species were
met with; the most brilliantly coloured being <i>M.
cruentata</i> which has the plumage of the body scarlet and
the wings washed with the same colour, another species
<i>M. obscura</i> has the entire plumage smoky-grey, and four
forms are intermediate between these two types of
colouration, being partly scarlet and partly grey. The
seventh is a very small and very rare species (<i>Œdistoma
pygmæum</i>), which was described by Count Salvadori
from the Arfak Peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>The other section contains a number of larger species,
mostly with dull greenish or brownish plumage and
nearly all with a yellow tuft or patch on the ear-coverts.
Though rather uninteresting-looking birds several are
really of great scientific value, being new to the National
Collection, and one, <i>Ptilotis mimikæ</i> proved to be new to
Science. The largest form is the curious Friar-bird
(<i>Philemon novæ-guineæ</i>) with the bare sides of the face
and neck black and a swollen knob on the base of the
bill. It was generally met with in pairs and inhabited
the tops of the tallest forest trees whence its peculiar cry
might constantly be heard.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>NECTARINIIDÆ</i>—SUN-BIRDS.</h3>

<p>The Sun-birds are represented by two species <i>Cinnyris
aspasiæ</i> and <i>C. frenata</i>. The male of the former is
deep black with a dark metallic green cap, shoulders and
lower back, and purple throat, while the female is olive
above, and dull yellow below, with a grey head and
throat. The latter species is dull yellow above, brilliant
yellow below, with a purple throat in the male, which is
absent in the female.</p>

<p>Mr. Goodfellow tells us that among the riot of parasitic
plants which covered the trees a few Sun-birds and
Honey-eaters might always be seen. The nests of the
former, suspended from fallen and partially submerged
dead trees, were continuously swinging from side to side,
the strong current in the river keeping the trees in perpetual
motion. These nests might easily be mistaken
for a handful of drift left there by the river.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>DICÆIDÆ</i>—FLOWER-PECKERS.</h3>

<p><i>Dicæum diversum</i> and <i>Melanocharis chloroptera</i>, a
dull-looking greenish-grey species described by Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
Salvadori, were the only Flower-peckers met with. They
are small Tit-like birds allied to the Sun-birds, but with
a short bill serrated along the edges of the mandibles.
Both species were very common everywhere except on
the coast and were extremely tame.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ZOSTEROPIDÆ</i>—WHITE-EYES.</h3>

<p><i>Zosterops chrysolæma</i>, a beautiful little species with
the upper-parts golden-olive, the throat and under tail-coverts
yellow, and the breast and belly pure white, was
the only species met with of this most numerous and
widely distributed group. The popular name White-eye
is derived from the ring of tiny white plumes which encircles
the eye in all. They resemble Titmice both in
their mode of life and notes. The only pair observed
were met with on the Iwaka River, and the species is
probably more numerous in the higher parts of the
mountains.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>LANIIDÆ</i>—SHRIKES.</h3>

<p>The large Shrike-like birds with powerful hooked bills
known as the Piping-Crows are represented by two members
of the genus <i>Cracticus</i>; <i>C. cassicus</i>, a black and
white species, and <i>C. quoyi</i>, with uniform black plumage.
Both are much like their well-known Australian representatives,
but smaller. <i>C. cassicus</i> was much the
commoner bird and was generally observed feeding on
berries and fruits in high trees, its actions being very
Crow-like.</p>

<p>The Pachycephaline group of birds allied to the true
Shrikes is represented by half-a-dozen species, two of
which proved to be undescribed: a grey form with a
white throat <i>Pachycephala approximans</i> and a black
species with a white breast and belly, <i>P. dorsalis</i>.
Brilliantly coloured orange-yellow and black, or orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>yellow
and grey species were represented by <i>Pachycephala
aurea</i> and <i>Pachychare flavogrisea</i>.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>PRIONOPIDÆ</i>—WOOD-SHRIKES.</h3>

<p>This group is represented by <i>Rhectes cristatus</i> and <i>R.
ferrugineus</i> in which both sexes are rufous and by <i>R.
nigripectus</i> with the sexes different, the male being partly
black and partly chestnut. <i>Pinarolestes megarhynchus</i>,
an allied species with the sexes alike, is brown above and
dull rufous below. Some of these Wood-Shrikes lay
peculiar looking eggs of a long oval shape and large for
the size of the bird. The ground-colour is purplish- or
pinkish-grey with scattered spots or small blotches of
dark purplish-brown or maroon-brown, often blurred at
the edges and running into the ground-colour. These
eggs have on several occasions been palmed off on
travellers in British New Guinea as eggs of the Red
Bird-of-Paradise, which they do not in any way
resemble.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ARTAMIDÆ</i>—SWALLOW-SHRIKES.</h3>

<p>These birds which closely resemble Swallows in their
mode of life are represented by one species only, <i>Artamus
leucopygialis</i>, a grey bird with the breast and rump white.
It was common along the coast, and was generally seen
either perched on some dead tree or skimming swiftly
over the sands.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>TIMELIIDÆ</i>—BABBLERS.</h3>

<p>We now come to the Timeline group of birds: of
these we may mention two striking-looking species of
<i>Eupetes</i>. One, <i>E. nigricrissus</i>, with the plumage slate-blue
and the throat white, edged with black, was met
with on the Mimika; the other, <i>E. pulcher</i>, was only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
seen further east on the Wataikwa River. It is very
similar to the above, but has the crown and back rich-chestnut,
instead of slate. Both species are ground-birds
and usually found in pairs; they are rather difficult to
procure as, when disturbed, they instantly conceal themselves
among the trunks of the trees and vegetation.
The Scimitar Babblers were represented by the reddish-brown
<i>Pomatorhinus isidori</i>.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CAMPOPHAGIDÆ</i>—CUCKOO-SHRIKES.</h3>

<p>The Cuckoo-Shrikes are well represented in the collection,
no fewer than eleven species having been obtained.
They belong to four genera and vary much in colour:
the large <i>Graucalus cæruleogrisea</i> has the entire plumage
bluish-grey, except the axillaries and under wing-coverts
which are pale cinnamon and the male has a black patch
in front of eye. Another genus <i>Edoliisoma</i> is represented
by <i>E. melas</i> of which the male is entirely black, and the
female chestnut and brown. A very attractive and
brilliantly coloured species is <i>Campochæra sloetii</i>, forming
a marked contrast to other members of the group. The
greater part of its plumage is orange-yellow, the forehead
white, the middle of the crown yellow and the wings black
and white; the male has the cheeks, throat and chest black
glossed with dull green, while in the female these parts
are dull grey. Several examples of this very rare Cuckoo-Shrike
were procured on the Mimika River. It is no
doubt most nearly allied to the Minivets (<i>Pericrocotus</i>)
which inhabit the Indo-Chinese countries and islands,
the predominant colour of most of the males being scarlet
and of the females yellow.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>MUSCICAPIDÆ</i>—FLYCATCHERS.</h3>

<p>Flycatchers are very numerously represented and
among them two new forms were discovered, a Fan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>tailed
Flycatcher (<i>Rhipidura streptophora</i>) and a broad-billed
species <i>Myiagra mimikæ</i>. Among the more notable
forms we may mention <i>Monarcha aruensis</i>, a brilliant
yellow and black species; <i>Todopsis bonapartei</i>, the male
being vivid ultramarine-blue, purple and black, while the
female differs in having the back and sides dark chestnut
and the breast mostly white; lastly <i>Peltops blainvillei</i>, a
black bird with the rump, vent and tail-coverts scarlet, a
large white patch on each side of the head and another
on the middle of the mantle; the sexes are alike in
plumage.</p>

<p>The Fan-tailed Flycatchers were commonly seen on
the Mimika River in May and June when numbers were
busy hawking the canary-coloured May-flies which
swarmed at that time.</p>

<p>The Black-and-white Flycatcher (<i>Malurus alboscapulatus</i>)
frequented the tall grasses near the camp on the
Wataikwa River. It was a delightful little bird, very
tame and might constantly be seen crossing the open
spaces with an undulating flight.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>HIRUNDINIDÆ</i>—SWALLOWS.</h3>

<p>Two species of Swallows were met with <i>Hirundo
javanica</i> and <i>H. gutturalis</i>.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>PITTIDÆ</i>—PITTAS OR ANT-THRUSHES.</h3>

<p>Of the Ant-Thrushes or Pittas two species were met
with, both brilliantly plumaged birds. <i>Pitta mackloti</i>
which was far the commoner of the two, has a dark
crown, reddish-chestnut nape, and greenish-blue upper-parts;
the throat is black, the chest shining greyish-blue
and the breast and belly scarlet, divided from the chest
by a wide black band.</p>

<p>The other species, <i>Pitta novæ-guineæ</i>, which was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
less frequently met with, has the head and neck black
and the rest of the plumage dark green washed with
bluish on the breast, which is black down the middle.
The shoulders are shining silvery-blue and the vent and
under tail-coverts scarlet.</p>

<p>These long-legged Thrush-like birds are entirely
terrestrial in their habits and frequent the depths of the
forests. They can hop with great agility and escape on
the slightest alarm, but are easily taken in snares.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CUCULIDÆ</i>—CUCKOOS.</h3>

<p>Among the Cuckoos, the largest is a species of
“Crow-pheasant” or “Lark-heeled” Cuckoo, <i>Centropus
menebiki</i>, a bird of black plumage glossed with dark green,
with a large whitish-horn bill and heavy slate-coloured
legs and toes.</p>

<p>An allied, but smaller and rarer species, <i>C. bernsteini</i>,
was met with near the mouth of the Mimika. It is very
similar in plumage to the above, but is easily distinguished
by its smaller size, black bill and long, nearly
straight hind-claw. Both are almost entirely ground-birds
of skulking habits. Several other species of
Cuckoo were met with, and among these <i>Cuculus micropterus</i>,
the eastern form of the Common Cuckoo, closely
resembling our familiar bird. The rarest species
obtained was <i>Microdynamis parva</i>, a remarkable little
Cuckoo about the size of a Thrush, first described by
Count Salvadori in 1875. The origin of the type
specimen is uncertain, but it is believed to have been
obtained by Beccari in the Moluccas. Subsequently, Dr.
H. O. Forbes procured female examples in the Astrolabe
Mountains. Mr. Claude Grant obtained an adult male
and female which form a valuable addition to the
National Collection. The general plumage is brown,
but in the male the top of the head and the malar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
stripe are black, glossed with steel-blue and the cheeks
and throat are cinnamon. In both sexes the bill is
short, thick and curved. The male has the eye bright
red, while in the female it is hazel.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CYPSELIDÆ</i>—SWIFTS.</h3>

<p>The Swifts, though of especial interest, are not very
numerously represented in the collection. The commonest
species was that known as the Esculent Swiftlet (<i>Collocalia
fuciphaga</i>) which produces the best kind of edible
nest.</p>

<p>A very interesting discovery was the existence in
New Guinea of the large fork-tailed species <i>Collocalia
whiteheadi</i> originally described by myself from the highlands
of Luzon, Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>A remarkable Spine-tailed Swift (<i>Chætura novæ-guineæ</i>)
is new to the National Collection. It was fairly
common on the Mimika River and originally described
by Count Salvadori from specimens procured by D’Albertis
on the Fly River.</p>

<p>A pair of the magnificent Moustached Swift (<i>Macropteryx
mystacea</i>) with a wing expanse of more than two
feet were also procured. The plumage of this bird is
mostly grey, but the crown, wings, and long deeply-forked
tail are black glossed with purplish-blue. The
eye-brows and moustache-stripes as well as the scapulars
are white, the two former being composed of lengthened,
narrow, pointed plumes. The male has a small chestnut
spot behind the ear-coverts which is absent in the female.
The nesting-habits of this species are very curious, it
makes a very small exposed half-saucer-shaped nest of
bark and feathers gummed by saliva to a branch or
stump barely large enough to contain the single white
egg, and ridiculously small in comparison with the size
of the bird. When incubating, the greater part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
bird’s body must rest on the branch to which the nest
is attached.</p>

<h3>FAMILIES <i>CAPRIMULGIDÆ</i> AND <i>PODARGIDÆ</i>—NIGHTJARS
AND FROG-MOUTHS.</h3>

<p>The common Nightjar of the country found along
the shingly banks of the rivers was <i>Caprimulgus macrurus</i>,
a widely distributed species. After the ground had been
cleared for the base camp at Wakatimi it was visited
every evening by a number of Nightjars, which no doubt
found such a large open space an admirable hunting-ground
and the members of the Expedition derived great
pleasure from watching their graceful evolutions. Another
very rare Nightjar was <i>Lyncornis papuensis</i>, not previously
included in the National Collection. Frog-mouths
were represented by the larger species <i>Podargus
papuensis</i> and the smaller, <i>P. ocellatus</i>. At some of the
stopping places on the river night was made hideous
by their mournful cries repeated to distraction on every
side, and ending up with a sharp snap.</p>

<p>A single example of the rare Wallace’s Owlet-Nightjar
(<i>Ægotheles wallacei</i>) was collected by Mr. G. C. Shortridge
on the Wataikwa River. It has a peculiar uniform
blackish upper plumage, without any trace of a distinct
nuchal collar. No doubt, like its Australian ally, it
roosts in holes in trees during the daytime and captures
its prey on the wing at night, like the true Nightjars,
though the flight is said to be less tortuous.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>BUCEROTIDÆ</i>—HORNBILLS.</h3>

<p>The only representative of the <i>Bucerotidæ</i> is the
Wreathed Hornbill (<i>Rhytidoceros plicatus</i>) a large bird
with a casque formed of overlapping plates on the base
of the upper mandible. The male is black with the head
and neck chestnut and the tail white, while the female<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
differs in having the head and neck black. It was plentiful
everywhere and its flesh was reported to be good eating.
It frequented the fruit-bearing trees in company with
various species of Pigeons and Mr. Claude Grant on one
or two occasions observed pairs at what he took to be
their nesting-holes high up in the bare trunks of very tall
trees. Their heavy noisy flight and raucous call, continually
repeated, renders these birds difficult to overlook.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>MEROPIDÆ</i>—BEE-EATERS.</h3>

<p>A species of Bee-eater, <i>Merops ornata</i>, was common
about the base camp. It ranges to Australia, the
Moluccas and westwards to the Lesser Sunda group. Mr.
Goodfellow says it swarmed in some places after the
month of April; though previous to that date none had
been met with.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CORACIIDÆ</i>—ROLLERS.</h3>

<p>Two species of Rollers inhabit the Mimika district
<i>Eurystomus crassirostris</i>, a greenish-blue species with
brilliant ultramarine throat, quills and tail-feathers and
vermilion bill and feet; and a smaller species <i>E. australis</i>
with brownish-green upper-parts, verditer-blue breast
and bluish-green bases to the tail-feathers.</p>

<p>Both Bee-eaters and Rollers were common in flocks
along the banks of the Mimika during April and May
when preying on the canary-coloured May-fly, which
swarmed on the waters at that season.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ALCEDINIDÆ</i>—KINGFISHERS.</h3>

<p>Kingfishers were well represented in the Mimika
district and Mr. Goodfellow says that the Sacred Kingfisher
(<i>Halcyon sanctus</i>) was undoubtedly the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
conspicuous bird about the base camp, where its harsh
cry could be heard all through the hot hours of the day.
The huts and storehouses were infested by myriads of
black crickets, which take the place of the cockroaches
found in other countries and commit fearful havoc
among stores and personal possessions. The constant
packing up of goods to send up river drove thousands of
these insects to seek shelter in other parts of the camp,
and, at such times, Kingfishers became very tame and
darted in and out among the buildings, taking advantage
of the feast thus afforded. Mr. Claude Grant shot a
single specimen of the lovely Kingfisher <i>H. nigrocyanea</i>,
the only one obtained. It has the crown, wings, upper
tail-coverts, tail, and breast dark ultramarine blue, the
rump cobalt-blue, the throat and a band across the
breast pure white, and the remainder of the plumage
black. Another species met with at the base camp was
<i>H. macleayi</i> with purple head, wings and tail, verditer-blue
back, white lores, collar and under-parts, and
cinnamon flanks. Only one example of this fine bird was
procured. Others were the dark purplish-blue and
chestnut <i>Alcyone lessoni</i>, about the size of our Common
Kingfisher and the much smaller <i>A. pusilla</i> similarly
coloured above, but with the under-parts pure white.</p>

<p><i>Ceyx solitaria</i>, a closely allied species, with purple
spangled upper-parts and cinnamon-yellow under-parts
was also found on the Mimika and Mr. Goodfellow was
surprised to find this diminutive species which he had
believed to be exclusively a fish-eater, greedily devouring
a canary-coloured May-fly which swarmed on the waters
of the Mimika during April and May.</p>

<p>On the river a few specimens of the large “Jackass”
Kingfisher (<i>Dacelo intermedia</i>) were obtained, but the
species was by no means common. The most conspicuous
bird was Gaudichaud’s Kingfisher (<i>Sauromarptis gaudichaudi</i>)
and its loud grating call might be heard in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
directions. The adult is a very handsome bird, the black
of the upper-parts being relieved by the electric-blue tips
to the wing-coverts and feathers of the lower back and
rump, the wings and tail are washed with dull purplish-blue,
the throat is white and extends in a buff collar
round the neck, the under wing-coverts are buff and the
breast and rest of the under-parts deep chestnut. The
natives brought numbers of the half-fledged young of
this species to the base camp during May and June and
many were purchased by the Javanese soldiers and
convicts; but as they fed them on boiled rice only, their
lives were brief. The great Shoe-billed Kingfisher
(<i>Clytoceyx</i>) was not met with by the members of our
Expedition, but Dr. Van Oort has described a new form
which he calls <i>Clytoceyx rex imperator</i>, from a specimen
procured by Dr. Lorentz on the Noord River. Another
large species, <i>Melidora macrorhinus</i>, with a curious brown
spotted plumage above was not uncommon; it usually
frequented the lower branches and undergrowth within a
few feet of the ground and when disturbed merely
mounted to a more conspicuous perch.</p>

<p>The lovely Racquet-tailed species of the genus
<i>Tanysiptera</i> were not procured, though Dr. H. A.
Lorentz met with a specimen on the Noord River.</p>

<h3>FAMILIES <i>PSITTACIDÆ</i> AND <i>LORIIDÆ</i>—PARROTS
AND LORIES.</h3>

<p>Another very numerously represented group is the
Parrots of which twenty-two different species were
procured, varying in size from the Great Black Cockatoo
(<i>Microglossus aterrimus</i>), which is about the size of a
Raven and has an enormously powerful bill, to the
tiny Pygmy Parrot (<i>Nasiterna keiensis</i>) which is about
the size of a Golden-crested Wren. This latter species
has recently been described by Mr. Walter Rothschild
as new, under the name of <i>Nasiterna viridipectus</i> from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
specimens obtained by A. S. Meek in the Oetakwa district,
but they do not seem to differ from the birds found
on the Kei and Aru Islands and also in the neighbourhood
of the Fly River. The plumage is green, paler
below, the crown dull orange, the shoulders spotted
with black, the middle-tail feathers blue and the outer
pairs black with yellow and green tips. A few solitary
Black Cockatoos might be seen on the lower River,
sitting on the tops of the highest trees; their loud
whistle always attracted attention and even on their
high perches their red faces and erect crests were conspicuous.
The Common Cockatoo of the country was
<i>Cacatua triton</i>, a moderate sized species with a yellow
crest which was met with in small numbers throughout
the mangrove belt, but it was a shy bird and when
approached always flew away, screaming. Lories of
different kinds were numerous and included some of the
most brilliantly coloured species, <i>Lorius erythrothorax</i>
combining in its plumage black, crimson, scarlet, purple,
blue, green and bright yellow. The adult has the under
wing-coverts uniform scarlet in marked contrast to the
bright yellow inner webs of the primary quills, but in
younger birds the smaller under wing-coverts are mottled
with scarlet, blue, black, green and yellow and the long
outer series are yellow with greyish-black ends, making
a dark band at the base of the quills. In this stage the
bird has been described by Dr. A. B. Meyer as <i>Lorius
salvadorii</i>.</p>

<p>A less brilliantly coloured and more common species
in the neighbourhood of the Mimika was <i>Eos fuscatus</i>
which has the general colour above sooty-black shaded
on the middle of the crown, neck, etc. with reddish-orange
and the under-parts widely banded with scarlet.
A lovely species with a longer tail was <i>Trichoglossus
cyanogrammus</i> which is green with a blue face and greenish-yellow
collar, and has the scarlet chest-feathers edged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
with purple, while the belly and flanks are yellow barred
with green.</p>

<p>The tiniest Lory is <i>Loriculus meeki</i>, a minute species,
about the size of a Blue Titmouse, with brilliant green
plumage, orange-yellow forehead, and the rump and
upper tail-coverts as well as a spot on the throat scarlet.
The female differs in having the forehead and cheeks
verditer-green.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Geoffroyus</i> is represented by two species:
the commoner <i>G. aruensis</i> with the plumage green, the
male having the crown and nape violet-blue and the
rest of the head and neck scarlet, while in the female
these parts are brown; also the much rarer <i>G. simplex</i>
which is entirely green with a dull lilac blue ring round the
neck. This latter is a very rare bird in collections, but
was seen on the higher parts of the mountains above the
Iwaka River in flocks of upwards of twenty individuals.</p>

<p>Other small and brilliantly coloured species of Lories
are <i>Charmosynopsis pulchella</i> and <i>C. multistriata</i>, the
latter a remarkable new species with green plumage, and
the whole of the under-parts streaked with bright yellow.
It was recently described by Mr. Rothschild from a male,
shot by A. S. Meek on the Oetakwa River; a second
specimen, a female, was obtained on the Mimika by
Mr. Goodfellow. We must also mention <i>Chalcopsittacus
scintillans</i>, <i>Hypocharmosyna placens</i>, <i>Charmosyna josephinæ</i>,
the rare <i>Glossopsittacus goldiei</i>, and three species
of <i>Cyclopsittacus</i>, viz. <i>C. melanogenys</i>, which is green
with a white throat, black cheeks, deep orange breast,
and ultramarine wings; <i>C. diophthalmus</i>; and <i>C. godmani</i>,
a new and handsome species with the general
colour green, the head and nape orange-scarlet, the
upper mantle orange-yellow, the cheeks covered with
long, pointed, yellowish feathers, and the chest verditer-blue.</p>

<p>Behind the camp at Wakatimi lay a swamp which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. Goodfellow tells us was every night the roosting-place
of thousands of Lories, chiefly <i>Eos fuscatus</i>, and
there were also smaller flocks of <i>Trichoglossus cyanogrammus</i>.
Long before sunset and until it was quite
dusk flocks of many hundred birds coming from all
directions flew over with a deafening noise. Often some
weak branch would give way under their weight, causing
a panic just as the noise was beginning to subside, and
clouds of these birds would again circle around, seeking
a fresh roosting place and keeping up a continual din.</p>

<p>One of the most peculiar Parrots, and bearing a
marked external resemblance to the Kea of New Zealand,
is the Vulturine Parrot (<i>Dasyptilus pesqueti</i>) which has
the black skin of the face almost entirely bare, the
plumage black and scarlet on the wings, rump and belly,
the breast feathers having pale sandy margins. Its
hoarse, grating call, quite unlike that of any other
species, could be heard a long way off, and was continually
uttered when on the wing. Mr. Goodfellow
says it usually moves about in parties of four or five
individuals, and that occasionally as many as seven may
be seen together. When not feeding they always select
the tallest trees to rest in, preferring dead ones which
tower about the general level of the jungle, and in
which they remain for hours at a time in rain or sunshine.
They do not climb after the usual manner of
Parrots, but jump from branch to branch with a jerky
movement, like the Lories, and with a rapid flicking
movement of the wings. They feed entirely on soft
fruits, chiefly wild figs. Apparently the species feeds on
the plains and retires to the mountains to roost, for
every evening flocks or pairs were observed passing high
over the camp at Parimau, and making their way
towards the Saddle-peak range.</p>

<p>A handsome new Parroquet of the genus <i>Aprosmictus</i>
was discovered, and has been named <i>A. wilhelminæ</i>, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
honour of the Queen of Holland. The male has the
head, neck and under-parts scarlet, the wings green, with
a pale yellow green band across the coverts, the mantle
and back mostly deep purplish-blue, and the tail black
tinged with purplish.</p>

<p>Finally, the Eclectus Parrot (<i>Eclectus pectoralis</i>) was
common. The remarkable difference in the colouration
of the sexes might lead some to believe that they belonged
to quite different species, the male being mostly green
with scarlet sides and under wing-coverts, while the
female is maroon with the head, neck and breast scarlet,
and the mantle, belly, sides and under wing-coverts blue.</p>

<h3>FAMILIES <i>BUBONIDÆ</i> AND <i>STRIGIDÆ</i>—WOOD-OWLS AND
BARN-OWLS.</h3>

<p>The only Owl of which examples were obtained was
a small species of Brown Hawk-Owl (<i>Ninox theomaca</i>),
with the upper-parts, back, wings and tail uniform dark
brown, and the under-parts deep chestnut. It was a
strictly nocturnal species, and confined to the jungle along
the base of the mountains, where its weird double call
“yon-yon” might constantly be heard after dark.</p>

<p>A form of the Barn-Owl (<i>Strix novæ-hollandiæ</i>),
which occurs in the district, was not obtained by the
Expedition.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>FALCONIDÆ</i>—EAGLES AND HAWKS.</h3>

<p>New Guinea possesses a very remarkable Harpy-Eagle
(<i>Harpyopsis novæ-guineæ</i>) allied to the Harpy Eagles of
America and to the Great Monkey-eating Eagle (<i>Pithecophaga
jefferyi</i>) which inhabits the forests of the Philippine
Islands. The New Guinea bird is like a large
Goshawk, having a long tail and comparatively short and
rounded wings; the feet are armed with very powerful
claws, but in strength and power it is far inferior to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
great Philippine ally or to the still more powerful species
inhabiting Central America. Mr. Claude Grant says that
this species was seldom met with; it has a rather loud
cry and a beautiful soaring flight, often in ascending
circles. Besides this large Eagle, two species of Goshawk
<i>Astur etorques</i> and <i>A. poliocephalus</i> were met with, likewise
a small chestnut and white Brahminy Kite (<i>Haliastur
girrenera</i>). A small Sparrow-Hawk was obtained near
the mouth of the Mimika River, but being in immature
plumage its identification is at present uncertain. Reinwardt’s
Cuckoo-Falcon (<i>Baza reinwardti</i>) with a crested
head and banded breast, was rather a rare bird and
appears to feed largely on insects.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>PHALACROCORACIDÆ</i>—CORMORANTS.</h3>

<p>The small black-backed white-breasted species <i>Phalacrocorax
melanoleucus</i> is the only representative of this
group. Several specimens were shot on the upper waters
of the Mimika, at Parimau and at the base camp at
Wakatimi.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ANATIDÆ</i>—DUCKS.</h3>

<p>The handsome white-necked Sheld-duck (<i>Tadorna
radjah</i>) differs from the Australian form in being much
darker on the back, the plumage being practically black
with indistinct mottlings of dull rufous on the mantle.
This dark form, found also in the Moluccas, was common
about the mouth of the Mimika River. The more rufous-backed
Australian form has been named <i>T. rufitergum</i> by
Dr. Hartert.</p>

<p>The only other species of duck brought home was an
immature male Garganey (<i>Querquedula discors</i>) shot on
the Kapare River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>IBIDIDÆ</i>—IBISES.</h3>

<p>The Eastern form of the Sacred Ibis (<i>Ibis stictipennis</i>)
was met with at the mouth of the Mimika. It is easily
distinguished from its western ally by having the innermost
secondaries mottled with black and white.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>ARDEIDÆ</i>—HERONS.</h3>

<p>Several different species of Herons were procured including
the Night Heron (<i>Nycticorax caledonica</i>); the
Yellow-necked Heron (<i>Dupetor flavicollis</i>); the White
Heron (<i>Herodias timoriensis</i>); and a Tiger-Bittern
(<i>Tigrisoma heliosylus</i>). The last named is a very fine bird
with the general colour above black boldly barred with
rufous and buff; the under-parts buff barred on the neck
and chest with black. The feathers on the neck and
chest are very long and broad and no doubt form a most
imposing ruff when the bird is displaying.</p>

<h3>FAMILIES <i>ŒDICNEMIDÆ</i>, <i>CHARADRIIDÆ</i> AND <i>LARIDÆ</i>—STONE-PLOVERS,
PLOVERS, AND GULLS.</h3>

<p>A number of small wading birds were also procured
near the mouth of the river, and two species of Terns,
but as all belong to well-known, widely distributed species,
there is no special interest attaching to them. I may
however mention that the great Australian Curlew
(<i>Numenius cyanopus</i>), and the large Australian Thicknee
(<i>Esacus magnirostris</i>) were among the species found at
the mouth of the Mimika.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>RALLIDÆ</i>—RAILS.</h3>

<p>The only Rail met with was an example of <i>Rallina
tricolor</i> which has the head, neck and chest bright chestnut,
and the rest of the plumage dark brown with white
bars on the wing-feathers. It is also met with in some
of the Papuan Islands and in North-eastern Australia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span></p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>COLUMBIDÆ</i>—PIGEONS.</h3>

<p>Pigeons were very numerously represented, no fewer
than twenty-six different species being obtained by
the Expedition. Some of the smaller forms are among
the most beautifully coloured birds met with in New
Guinea. The Crowned Pigeons (Goura) are represented
by <i>G. sclateri</i> which was fairly common near the base
camp and met with in all places visited by the Expedition.
In spite of the numbers shot for food during the
whole time the Expedition remained in the country,
the supply did not appear to diminish. This fine Pigeon
and a few others afforded the only fresh meat to be had.
On the canoe-journeys up the river Sclater’s Goura was
frequently met with in the early mornings in parties of
two or three searching for aquatic life along the muddy
banks. When disturbed they did not immediately take
flight, but with raised wings pirouetted around for a few
seconds and then flew to the nearest high tree. Mr.
Goodfellow found the remains of small crabs in their
stomachs and a large percentage of the birds shot were
infested by a small red parasite, the same, or similar to
that which is known in other parts of New Guinea as
“Scrub-itch.”</p>

<p>Another very handsome bird is the Ground-Pigeon
(<i>Otidiphaps nobilis</i>) with the head bluish-black, the nape
dull metallic green, the mantle and wings purplish-chestnut
and the rest of the plumage deep purple, all being
more or less metallic. Its long legs and the upward
carriage of its long tail give it much the appearance of a
Bantam hen. It was fairly common, but being extremely
shy was rarely met with.</p>

<p>Among the larger Fruit-Pigeons we must specially
mention <i>Carpophaga pinon</i> which has the general appearance
of a large Wood-Pigeon. It was met with in large
flocks and proved an excellent bird for the table. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
very striking species, of rather lesser proportions and
very much rarer, was Muller’s Fruit-Pigeon (<i>Carpophaga
mulleri</i>) easily distinguished by its white throat, the bold
black ring round its neck and its shining chestnut mantle.
Among the handsomest was <i>Carpophaga rufiventris</i>, a
bird with the breast cinnamon and the wings and back
metallic green, copper and purple. Lastly a very striking
form was the large creamy-white Pigeon (<i>Myristicivora
spilorrhoa</i>) with the flight feathers, tips of the tail-feathers
and under tail-coverts blackish. It appears
to be entirely confined to the mangrove swamps and was
observed breeding in May along the creeks near the
mouth of the river, no less than seven nests being found
in one tree.</p>

<p>As already stated among the smaller Fruit-Pigeons
many are very beautifully marked and brilliantly
coloured, but always with the most harmonious shades.
It would seem as though Nature had almost exhausted
her scheme of colouration in dealing with some of these
birds; for we find two totally different species, <i>Ptilopus
zonurus</i> and <i>P. gestroi</i>, occurring together in which the
markings and colours of the plumage are almost identical;
on the under-surface the two species are practically alike,
both have the chin and throat pale lavender, extending
in a ring round the neck, the throat orange, the chest
washed with vinous and the remainder of the under-parts
green; on the upper-surface, the top of the head and
nape are greenish-yellow and the rest of the upper-parts
green, but in <i>P. zonurus</i> the median wing-coverts are
green with a subterminal spot of bright pink, while in
<i>P. gestroi</i> the least wing-coverts are crimson and the
next series grey fringed with greenish-yellow. Another
parallel case of close resemblance is found between the
small <i>Ptilopus nanus</i> and the larger <i>P. coronulatus</i>.
Though really extremely distinct species the under-parts
are very similarly coloured both being green with a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
magenta patch on the middle of the breast and the belly
and under-tail coverts mostly bright yellow: viewed
from the upper surface the two birds are, however, very
different, <i>P. coronulatus</i> having the crown lilac-pink,
edged posteriorly with bands of crimson and yellow,
while <i>P. nanus</i> has the head green, but the ends of the
scapulars and secondaries are deep shining bluish-green,
tipped with bright yellow. Even more brilliantly
coloured species than the above are <i>Ptilopus pulchellus</i>,
<i>P. superbus</i>, <i>P. aurantiifrons</i> and <i>P. bellus</i>.</p>

<p>Near the camp at Wataikwa large flocks of D’Albertis’
Pigeon (<i>Gymnophaps albertisii</i>) were observed coming in
every evening from their feeding-grounds on the high
mountains to roost on the plains below. Mr. Goodfellow
tells us that their flight is extremely rapid and that their
strange aerial evolutions remind one of the common
“Tumbler” Pigeons.</p>

<p>The Long-tailed Cuckoo-Doves were represented
by the very large <i>Reinwardtœnas griseotincta</i> and the
smaller chestnut-plumaged <i>Macropygia griseinucha</i>; the
former being a large and abnormally long-tailed bird
with the head, mantle and under-parts grey, and the
back and tail chestnut.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>MEGAPODIIDÆ</i>—MEGAPODES OR MOUND-BUILDERS.</h3>

<p>The Game-birds are represented by three species of
Mound-builders, two being Brush-Turkeys and the other
a true Megapode (<i>Megapodius freycineti</i>). The fact that
two closely allied species of Brush-Turkeys are found in
the same district is of considerable interest. The common
species of the country <i>Talegallus fuscirostris</i> has a very
wide coastal range, being also found in S.E. New
Guinea and extending along the north coast to the
middle of Geelvinck Bay. The other species <i>T. cuvieri</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
is of western origin being hitherto known from the Arfak
Peninsula, and the islands of Salwatti, Mysol and Gilolo.
Its occurrence on the Iwaka river was quite unexpected
and no doubt the range of the two species overlap in the
neighbourhood of the Mimika in the south and in the
vicinity of Rubi on Geelvinck Bay in the north. In
both the plumage is black, but <i>T. cuvieri</i> is a larger bird
than <i>T. fuscirostris</i> and is easily recognised by having
the tibia feathered right down to the tibio-tarsal joint
and the bill orange-red instead of sooty-brown.</p>

<p>All these species are of the greatest interest on
account of their remarkable nesting habits, and their
nesting mounds of decaying vegetable matter were
conspicuous objects in the jungle. The eggs, which are
very large for the size of the birds, are buried among
the débris which the birds rake together into a large
heap, the young being hatched, as in an incubator, by the
warmth of the decaying leaves. The parent bird, after
burying its eggs, takes no further notice of them, but the
young on leaving the shell are fully feathered and able
to fly and take care of themselves.</p>

<h3>FAMILY <i>CASUARIIDÆ</i>—CASSOWARIES.</h3>

<p>The discovery made by Mr. Walter Goodfellow that
two distinct forms of two-wattled Cassowary occur side
by side on the Mimika River has greatly modified Mr.
Rothschild’s views on the classification of the genus, and
he now finds that the ten forms possessing two wattles,
when placed side by side fall naturally into two groups,
one consisting of the Common Cassowary (<i>Casuarius
casuarius</i>), divisible into six sub-species or races, and
the other of <i>C. bicarunculatus</i> which may be divided
into four sub-species. The large forms found on the
Mimika are <i>C. sclateri</i>, representing the first group, and
<i>C. intensus</i> representing the second. Both these birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
have a large elevated casque or helmet and differ chiefly
in the pattern and colouration of the bare neck-wattles.</p>

<p>These Cassowaries were seen at various times searching
for food in the pools and shallow waters of the
river-beds, and during the cross-country marches would
sometimes dash across the trail, affording but a momentary
glimpse.</p>

<p>The natives have distinct names for the male and
female birds and judging from the quantities of feathers
in their possession must often succeed in capturing them.
Eggs and newly-hatched chicks were brought in during
January and February. On one occasion at Parimau
some eggs must have been kept by the natives for a few
days before they hatched, for young were brought to the
camp which had evidently just emerged from the shells.</p>

<p>A very interesting discovery was made by Mr. Claude
Grant on the foot-hills, where he met with a new dwarf
species of Cassowary, <i>C. claudii</i>. It is allied to <i>C. papuanus</i>,
but has the hind part of the crown and occiput
black instead of white. Like that bird it has a low
triangular casque and belongs to a different section of
the genus from the two larger species already mentioned.</p>

<p><i>C. claudii</i> has very brilliantly coloured soft parts.
The occiput and sides of the head are entirely black;
between the gape and the ear is a patch of deep plum-colour;
the upper half of the back of the neck is electric-blue,
shading into violet-blue on the sides and fore-part
of the neck including the throat; the lower half of the
back of the neck is orange-chrome, this colour extending
down the upper margin of a bare magenta-coloured area
situated on each side of the feathered part of the neck.
This fine bird is now mounted and on exhibition in the
Bird Gallery at the Natural History Museum.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX B</h2>

<h3>THE PYGMY QUESTION</h3>

<p class="center f09"><span class="smcap">By Dr. A. C. HADDON, F.R.S.</span></p>

<p>Pygmies, as their name implies, are very short men,
and the first question to decide is whether this short
stature is normal or merely a dwarfing due to unfavourable
environment. Although stature cannot be taken as
a trustworthy criterion of race, since it is very variable
within certain limits among most races, there are certain
peoples who may be described as normally tall, medium,
or short. The average human stature appears to be
about 1·675 m. (5 ft. 6 ins.). Those peoples who are
1·725 (5 ft. 8 ins.) or more in height are said to be tall,
those below 1·625 m. (5 ft. 4 ins.) are short, while those
who fall below 1·5 m. (4 ft. 11 ins.) are now usually
termed pygmies. One has only to turn to the investigations
of the Dordogne district by Collignon and others to
see how profoundly <i>la misère</i> can affect the stature of a
population living under adverse conditions, for example
in the canton of Saint Mathieu there are 8·8 per cent.
with a stature below 1·5 m. But when one finds within
one area, as in the East Indian region, distinct peoples
of medium, short and pygmy stature, living under conditions
which appear to be very similar, one is inclined
to suspect a racial difference between them, and the
suspicion becomes confirmed if we find other characters
associated with pygmy stature.</p>

<p>Pygmy peoples are widely distributed in Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Africa, but these Negrillos, as they are often termed, do
not concern us now.</p>

<p>Asiatic pygmies have long been known, but it is only
comparatively recently that they have been studied
seriously, and even now there remains much to be
discovered about them. There are two main stocks on
the eastern border of the Indian Ocean, who have a very
short stature and are respectively characterised by curly
or wavy hair and by hair that grows in close small spirals—the
so-called woolly hair.</p>

<p>(i.) The Sakai or Senoi of the southern portion of the
Malay Peninsula are typical examples of the former
stock, their average stature is slightly above the pygmy
limit, but they need not detain us longer as they belong
to a different race of mankind from the woolly-haired
stock. It may be mentioned however that cymotrichous
(curly-haired), dolichocephalic (narrow-headed), dark-skinned
peoples of very short stature, racially akin to the
Sakai, have been found in East Sumatra and in Celebes
(Toala) more or less mixed with alien blood; and quite
recently Moszkowski, as will be mentioned later, has
suggested that the islands of Geelvink Bay, Netherlands
New Guinea, were originally inhabited by the same stock.
All these peoples together with the Vedda and some
jungle tribes of the Deccan are now regarded as remnants
of a once widely distributed race to which the term Pre-Dravidian
has been applied; it is also believed by many
students that the chief element in the Australians is of
similar origin.</p>

<p>(ii.) For a long time it has been known that there are
three groups of ulotrichous (woolly-haired), brachycephalic
(broad-headed), dark-skinned, pygmy peoples
inhabiting respectively the Andaman Islands, the Malay
Peninsula and the Philippines; to this race the name
Negrito is universally applied. We can now include in
it a fourth element from New Guinea. The physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
characters of these several groups may be summarised as
follows:</p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Andamanese</span>, who are sometimes erroneously
called Mincopies, inhabit the Andaman Islands in
the Bay of Bengal. Their head <i>hair</i> is extremely
frizzly (woolly), fine in texture, lustreless and seldom
more than two or three inches long, or five inches when
untwisted, its colour varies between black, greyish
black, and sooty, the last perhaps predominating. Hair
only occasionally grows on the face and then but
scantily. There is little or no hair over the surface of
the body. The <i>skin</i> has several shades of colour between
bronze or dark copper, sooty, and black, the predominating
colour being a dull leaden hue like that of a black-leaded
stove. The average <i>stature</i> of 48 males is 1·492 m.
(4 ft. 10-3/4 ins.), the extremes being 1·365 m. (4 ft. 5-3/4 ins.)
and 1·632 m. (5 ft. 4-1/4 ins.). The <i>head</i> is moderately
brachycephalic, the average <i>cranial index</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the ratio
of the breadth to the length, the length being taken as
100) in male skulls is 81, thus the <i>cephalic index</i> of the
living would be about 83. The <i>features</i> may be described
as: face broad at the cheek-bones; eyes prominent;
nose much sunken at the root, straight and small; lips
full but not everted; chin small; the jaws do not
project.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Semang</span> live in the central region of the
Malay Peninsula, some of them are known under the
names of Udai, Pangan, Hami and Semán. The <i>hair</i>
of the head is short, universally woolly, and black.
Skeat says it is of a brownish black, not a bluish black
like that of the Malays, and Martin alludes to a reddish
shimmer when light falls on it, but says there is not a
brownish shimmer as in the Sakai. Hair is rare and
scanty on face and body. Skeat describes the <i>skin</i>
colour as dark chocolate brown approximating in some
Kedah Negritos to glossy black, and Martin says the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
skin of the chest is dark brown with reddish tinges,
while that of the face is mainly dark brown, the remainder
being medium brown, with reddish or pure
brown tinges. The data for the <i>stature</i> are not very
satisfactory, the best are a series of 17 males by Annandale
and Robinson, the average being 1·528 m.
(5 ft. 0-1/4 in.), with extreme, of 1·372 m. (4 ft. 6 ins.) and
1·604 (5 ft. 3 ins.). The average <i>cephalic index</i> is
about 78 or 79, the extremes ranging from about 74 to
about 84. The Semang are thus mesaticephalic on the
average. According to Skeat the <i>face</i> is round; the
forehead rounded, narrow and projecting, or as it were
“swollen”; the nose short and flattened, the nostrils
much distended, the breadth remarkably great, five
adult males having an average nasal index of 101·2, the
20 measured by Annandale and Robinson varied from
81·3 to 108·8 with an average of 97·1, but four men
measured by Martin had an average index of 83·5. The
cheek-bones are broad; jaws often protrude slightly; lips
not as a rule thick, Martin remarks that very characteristic
of both the Semang and the Sakai is the great
thickening of the integumental part of the upper lip,
the whole mouth region projecting from the lower edge
of the nose; this convexity occurs in 70 per cent., and
is well shown in his photographs.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Aeta</span> live in the mountainous districts of
the larger islands and in some of the smaller islands
of the Philippines. It is convenient to retain this name
for the variously named groups of Philippine Negritos,
many of whom show admixture with other peoples.
The <i>hair</i> of the head is universally woolly except when
mixture may be suspected or is known; Reed says it is
uniformly of a dirty black colour, sometimes sunburnt
on the top to reddish brown; Worcester describes it as
usually black but it may be reddish brown, and Meyer as
a dark seal-brown to black. Reed says that the beard is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
very scanty but all adult males have some and that
there is very little body hair, but Worcester states that
the men often have abundant beards and a thick growth
of hair on the arms, chest and legs. The <i>skin</i> is described
as being of a dark chocolate brown, rather than
black, with a yellowish tinge on the exposed parts
(Reed), sooty black (Sawyer), or dark, sooty brown
(Worcester). The average <i>stature</i> of 48 men is 1·463 m.
(4 ft. 9-1/2 ins.), ranging from 1·282 m. (4 ft. 2-1/2 ins.) to
1·6 m. (5 ft. 3 ins.), but some of these were not pure
breeds (Reed); other observations also show a considerable
range in height. The <i>cephalic index</i> of 16
males averages 82·2, ranging from 78·8 to 92·3, ten
range between 80 and 85 (Reed). <i>Features</i>: typically
the nose is broad, flat, bridgeless, with prominent
arched alæ and nostrils invariably visible from the front.
Of 76 persons measured by Reed 4 males and 3
females had nasal indices below 89, 10 and 3 of 90-99,
20 and 13 of 100-109, 7 and 7 of 110-119, 6 and 3 above
120; the median of the males is 102, the extremes being
83·3 and 125, the median of the females is 105, their
extremes being 79·5 and 140·7; in other words they are
extremely platyrhine. The eyes are round. The lips
are moderately thick, but not protruding. A somewhat
pronounced convexity is sometimes seen between the
upper lip and the nose in the photographs of Meyer’s
and Folkmar’s Albums. Meyer says the projecting jaw
gives an ape-like appearance to the face, but Reed says
the Aeta have practically no prognathism, a statement
which is borne out by his and Folkmar’s photographs.</p>

<p>4. The discovery of pygmies in Netherlands New Guinea
by the Expedition has drawn public attention to a
problem of perennial interest to ethnologists. Nearly
twenty-five years ago Sir William Flower stated, “that
it (the Negrito race) has contributed considerably to form
the population of New Guinea is unquestionable. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
many parts of that great island, small round-headed
tribes live more or less distinct from the larger and
longer-headed people who make up the bulk of the
population.” (Lecture at the Royal Institution, April
13, 1888, reprinted in <i>Essays on Museums</i>, 1898, p. 302.)
No further information is given, nor are his authorities
mentioned. Perhaps he was alluding to the following
statement by de Quatrefages, “L’extension des Négritos
en Mélanésie est bien plus considérable. Ici leurs tribus
sont mêlées et juxtaposées à celles des Papouas probablement
dans toute la Nouvelle Guinée” (<i>Rev. d’Ethn.</i>, 1882,
p. 185); subsequently he wrote, “La confusion regrettable
(namely the confusion of the brachycephalic
Negrito-Papuans with the dolichocephalic Papuans, of
which Earl, Wallace, Meyer and others have been guilty)
est cause que l’on n’a pas recherché les traits differentiels
qui peuvent distinguer les Negritos-Papous des vrais
Papouas au point de vue de l’état social, des mœurs, des
croyances, des industries.” (<i>Les Pygmées</i>, 1887, p. 97,
English Translation, 1895, p. 62.) Dr. A. B. Meyer,
from whose essay these quotations have been taken,
adds, “No, the confusion has not been in this case in
the heads of the travellers; a Negritic race, side by side
with the Papuan race, nobody has been able to discover,
just because it does not exist, and it does not exist
because the Papuan race, in spite of its variability, is on
the one hand a uniform race, and on the other as good
as identical with the Negritos.” (<i>The Distribution of the
Negritos</i>, 1899, p. 85.) When reviewing this essay in
<i>Nature</i> (Sept. 7, 1899, p. 433), I stated that I was inclined
to adopt the view that the various types exhibited by
the natives of New Guinea “point to a crossing of different
elements,” and do not “simply reveal the variability
of the race,” as Dr. Meyer provisionally believed.
While agreeing with Dr. Meyer that the “different conditions
of existence” (p. 80) in New Guinea probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
have reacted on the physical characters of the natives
(about which, however, we have extremely little precise
information), we have now sufficient evidence to prove
that the indigenous or true Papuan population has been
modified in places by intrusions from elsewhere, and of
late years data have been accumulating which point to
the existence of a pygmy population. Shortly before his
death, Dr. Meyer drew my attention to a more recent
statement of his views, in which he says, “Although I
formerly stated (<i>Negritos</i>, p. 87) that the question
whether the Papuans, <i>i.e.</i> the inhabitants of New Guinea,
are a uniform race with a wide range of variation or a
mixed race is not yet ripe for pronouncement, I am now
more inclined, after Mr. Ray’s discovery of the Papuan
linguistic family, to look upon them as a mixed race of
‘Negritos’ and Malays in the wider sense. I am eagerly
looking forward to the exploration of the interior of that
great island, for may it not be possible there to discover
the Negrito element in that old and more constant form
in which it persists in the Philippines, Andamans, and in
Malakka.” (<i>Globus</i>, <span class="smcap">XCIV.</span>, 1908, p. 192.) This later
view appears to me to be less tenable than his earlier
one, as it is difficult to see how a mixture of pygmy,
woolly-haired brachycephals with short, straight-haired
brachycephals (Malays) could give rise to the taller,
woolly-haired dolichocephalic Papuans.</p>

<p>The racial history of New Guinea has proved to be
unexpectedly complicated. We are now justified in
recognising at least two indigenous elements, the Negrito
and Papuan; the effect of the island populations to the
east has not yet been determined, but in the south-west
two immigrations at least from Melanesia have taken
place, which, with Seligmann, we may term Papuo-Melanesian.
(<i>Journ. R. Anth. Inst.</i>, <span class="smcap">XXXIX.</span> 1909,
pp. 246, 315; and <i>The Melanesians of Brit. New Guinea</i>,
1910.) It is, however, almost certain that future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
researches will reveal that the problem is not so simple
as that just indicated.</p>

<p>Writing in 1902, Dr. Weule states (<i>Globus</i>, <span class="smcap">LXXXII.</span>
p. 247) that he has no further doubts as to the existence
of pygmies in New Guinea, though it is not yet clear
whether they live in definite groups or as scattered
remnants among the taller peoples. He points out that
information as to the pygmies was of necessity scanty,
as expeditions had always followed the course of rivers
where encounter with them might least be expected,
since they are for the most part mountain people.
Through the activity of Sir William MacGregor and
others, British New Guinea is “the least unknown” part
of the whole island; there is therefore more likelihood of
pygmy peoples being discovered in German or Netherlands
New Guinea, the latter being entirely a <i>terra incognita</i>
from the geographical standpoint. Dr. Weule’s
article contains various references to previous literature
on the pygmy question, and three photographs of
pygmies from the middle Ramu are reproduced, which
show three men well under 142 cm. (4 ft. 8-3/4 ins.) in
height.</p>

<p>The later history of the discovery of a pygmy substratum
in the population of parts of New Guinea is as
follows:—</p>

<p>Dr. M. Krieger had visited the Sattelberg and the
neighbourhood of Simbang where he heard reports of
dwarfs from natives, but no European had seen them
(<i>Neu Guinea</i>, 1899, p. 143); subsequently Dr. R. Pöch
stayed from December 1904 to February 1905 in the Kai
area, which lies inland from Finschhafen in German New
Guinea. In the <i>Mitt. aus den deutschen Schutzgebieten</i>,
1907, he writes (p. 225): “During the first part of the
time I remained chiefly on the Sattelberg itself, and
observed and measured the various Kai frequenting the
Mission Station. In them I became acquainted with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
mountain tribe entirely different from the coast peoples
previously visited. In fifty men I found the average
height to be 152·5 cm. (5 ft.); the skulls are, as a rule,
mesocephalic to brachycephalic. Towards the coast
(Jabim) dolichocephaly becomes more usual and the
type also changes. Very small people are not infrequently
met with among the Kai.” Among 300 adult
males he found twelve ranging from 133 to 145·6 cm.
(4 ft. 4-1/2 ins. to 4 ft. 9-1/4 ins.). “For the present,” he adds,
“it cannot be determined whether this is merely a
variation in stature or whether we have here survivals
of an older smaller race not yet entirely merged in the
Kai” (<i>cf.</i> also <i>Sitzungsber. der Anth. Gesellschaft in Wien</i>,
1905, pp. 40 ff.). In the <i>Zeitschr. f. Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XXXIX.</span>, 1907,
p. 384, he states that on the north coast of British New
Guinea and in Normanby Island he often came across very
small people. Dr. O. Reche, in describing a journey up the
Kaiserin-Augusta river, says that, “the population consists
of three clearly distinguishable types or races, two
of which have long, very narrow skulls, and one a short
broad skull. Inland from the river bank there seems to
be in addition to these a pygmy-like people of small
growth; at all events, I found in some of the villages
situated on the upper river, among other skulls, some
which were remarkably small and of a special type, and
which must have been taken from enemies living further
inland.” (<i>Globus</i>, <span class="smcap">XCVII.</span> 1910, p. 286.)</p>

<p>Neuhauss studied the Sattelberg natives and is very
certain that a pygmy element occurs there. He notes
the stockiness of certain individuals, who have a long
powerful trunk and short limbs, whereas the Papuans
are lean and slender; the shortest man measured by him
was 1·355 m. (4 ft. 5-1/2 ins.). Again, the <i>cephalic index</i> of
260 Papuans averages 76·8, while that of thirty-two short
individuals averages 78·8, and on the Sattelberg 79·7,
some even ranging from 83-84·6. He also noticed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
the ears were short, wide and without lobe; the hands
and feet were unusually small. Von Luschan draws
attention to the convexity of the whole upper lip area
as in African pygmies. Neuhauss insists that the
pygmies are almost merged into the rest of the population,
and that their low stature is not due to poor
conditions. (<i>Zs. f. Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XLIII.</span>, 1911, p. 280.)</p>

<p>Dr. M. Moszkowski found that in Geelvink Bay the
hair is not always ulotrichous (woolly), as is usual with
Papuans, especially on Biak and Padeido Islands the hair
often recalls the cymotrichous (curly) hair of Veddas.
Other points of resemblance with wild tribes of Further
Asia are:—A very dainty graceful bone-structure, small
hands and feet, relatively short limbs compared to the
trunk, low stature, few being above 156 cm. and most
below 150 cm. (4 ft. 11 ins.), and now and then the
characteristic convex upper lip of the wild tribes (<i>Zs. f.
Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XLIII.</span> 1911, pp. 317, 318). On these grounds
Moszkowski inclines to think that the islands of Geelvink
Bay were originally peopled by pre-Malayan wild tribes
allied to the Vedda, Sakai, Toala, etc., and thus the
present population is the result of crossing between these
and immigrant Melanesians; true Malays came later.
Moszkowski has not yet published any head measurements
of these interesting people, and the evidence is insufficient
to decide whether this is a Pre-Dravidian or a
Negrito element in the population of these islands, the
curly character of the hair may be due as elsewhere in
New Guinea to racial mixture; the photograph of a
“Vedda-type” from Padeido island is by no means
convincing (<i>l.c.</i> p. 318).</p>

<p>Finally Guppy, Ribbe and Rascher report the occurrence
of very short people in the interior of the larger
islands of the Bismarck Archipelago and of the Solomon
Islands; recently Thurnwald refers to very small people
in the mountainous interior of Bougainville who speak a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
non-Melanesian language, one man from Mari mountain
had a stature of 1·39 m. (4 ft. 6-1/2 ins.). In the mountains
the mixed population consists of types recalling the
Solomon Islanders and “representatives of a small short-legged,
broad-faced, short-skulled, very hairy, wide-nosed
people.” (<i>Zs. f. Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XLII.</span> 1910, p. 109.)</p>

<p>Discussing the pygmies of Melanesia von Luschan referred
in 1910 (<i>Zs. f. Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XLII.</span>, p. 939) to bones brought
a century ago from the Admiralty Islands which must
have belonged to individuals 1·32-1·35 m. (4 ft. 4 ins.-4 ft.
5 ins.) in stature; it is unlikely that the type persists,
though Moseley mentions an unusually short man,
a little over 5 ft. (<i>Journ. Anth. Inst.</i> 1877, p. 384). In
the collection made by the German Marine Expedition
there are a number of extremely small skulls from New
Ireland, which von Luschan is convinced belong to
pygmies. Finsch brought from New Britain over thirty
years ago the smallest known skull of a normal adult
person; it came from the S.W. coast of Gazelle
Peninsula. Like four other extremely small feminine
skulls from New Britain this one is dolichocephalic (ceph.
index 73). Von Luschan is of opinion that the small
people of Melanesia represent an older stratum of population
than their tall neighbours.</p>

<p>While other travellers have come across what is now
accepted as a pygmy element in the population, the
members of this Expedition have for the first time
proved the existence of a pygmy people, known as the
<span class="smcap"><i>Tapiro</i></span>, who may be regarded as predominantly Negritos.
The <i>hair</i> is short, woolly and black, but seemed brown
in two or three cases, there is a good deal of hair on the
face and of short downy hair scattered about the body.
The <i>skin</i> is of a lighter colour than that of the neighbouring
Papuans, some individuals being almost yellow. The
<i>stature</i> averages 1·449 m. (4 ft. 9 ins.), ranging from
1·326 m. (4 ft. 4-1/4 ins.) to 1·529 m. (5 ft. 0-1/4in.). The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
<i>cephalic index</i> averages 79·5, varying from 66·9 to 85·1.
<i>Features</i>: The nose is straight and though described as
“very wide at the nostrils,” the mean of the indices is
only 83, the extremes being 65·5 to 94. The eyes are
noticeably larger and rounder than those of Papuans.
“The upper lip of many of the men is long and curiously
convex.”</p>

<p>At the same time that the Expedition discovered
pygmies in Netherlands New Guinea, Mr. R. W. Williamson
was investigating the Mafulu, a mountain people on
the upper waters of the Angabunga river in the Mekeo
District. He has shown (<i>The Mafulu Mountain People
of British New Guinea</i>, 1912) that in all probability these
and some neighbouring tribes are a mixture of Negritos,
Papuans and Papuo-Melanesians. Their invariably
woolly <i>hair</i> is generally dark brown, often quite dark,
approaching to black and sometimes perhaps quite black,
but frequently it is lighter and often not what we in
Europe should call dark; a beard and moustache are
quite unusual. The <i>skin</i> is dark sooty-brown. The
average stature is 1·551 m. (5 ft. 1 in.) ranging from
1·47 m. (4 ft. 10 ins.) to 1·63 m. (5 ft. 4 ins.). They are
fairly strong and muscular, but rather slender and slight
in development. The average <i>cephalic index</i> is 80 and
ranges from 74·7 to 86·8. <i>Features</i>: The average nasal
index is 84·3, the extremes being 71·4 and 100. The
eyes are dark brown and very bright. The lips are fine
and delicate.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Pöch had in 1906 measured
two Fergusson Island men with statures 1·403 and
1·425 m. (4 ft. 7-1/4 ins., 4 ft. 8 ins.), who told him that “all
the people in that tribe were as small or smaller.” (<i>Zs.
f. Ethnol.</i> <span class="smcap">XLII.</span> 1910, p. 941.)</p>

<p>On reading through the brief synopses which I have
given it is apparent that, with the possible exception of
the Andamanese, each of the Negrito peoples shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
considerable diversity in its physical characters and this
is more evident when more detailed accounts and photographs
are studied. There appears to be sufficient
evidence to show that a very ancient ulotrichous, low
brachycephalic, pygmy population once extended over
the Malay Peninsula and a great part (at least) of
Melanesia and New Guinea, but the existing groups do
not appear to be homogeneous judging from the diversity
in stature, head index and nasal index. Stature, as has
already been stated, is always recognised as subject to
considerable variation, but the bulk of the measurements
of these peoples fall below 1·5 m., and therefore indicate
a predominant very short population. The head indices
mainly show low brachycephaly; the occasional very low
indices may be due either to a Pre-Dravidian mixture or
in New Guinea, at all events, to a Papuan strain. The
former existence of a Pre-Dravidian stock in New Guinea
is highly probable, nor must it be overlooked that there
may have been a hitherto undescribed pygmy or very
short dolichocephalic ulotrichous stock in New Guinea
and Melanesia. The nasal index of these Negrito peoples
is very suggestive of racial complexity. Judging from
photographs, in the absence of measurements, the
Andamanese have by no means a broad nose, and a
mesorhine index is found in all the other groups, some
of the Tapiro and Mafulu are even leptorhine. A constantly
recurring feature is the convex upper lip, but
that also occurs among the Sakai. The problem now is
to determine what foreign elements have modified these
pygmies, and whether the Negrito stock itself will not
have to be subdivided into at least two groups.</p>

<p>The Negritos have certain cultural characters more
or less in common, some of which differentiate them
from their neighbours. There is very little artificial
deformation of the person. The Tapiro and Mafulu
alone do not tattoo or scarify the skin; Skeat says that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
the Semang “do not appear as a race to tattoo or
scarify,” and the Aeta scarify only occasionally. The
nasal septum is not pierced for a nose-stick by the
Andamanese and Aeta nor among the purer Semang
tribes, but the Tapiro and Mafulu do so. The Semang
women possess numerous bamboo combs which are
engraved with curious designs of a magical import,
similar combs are possessed by nearly every Aeta man
and woman. The Andamanese have no combs.</p>

<p>With regard to clothing, the male Andamanese are
nude, the females wear a small apron of leaves or a single
leaf, but one tribe, the Jarawa, go nude. The male
Semang frequently wear a loin-cloth, or simply leaves
retained by a string girdle, sometimes the women wear
this too or a fringed girdle made of the long black strings
of a fungus, but more usually a waist-cloth. The Aeta
men wear a loin-cloth and the women a waist-cloth.
The Mafulu men and women wear a perineal band of
bark cloth, while the Tapiro men wear a unique gourd
penis-sheath. A gourd or calabash is also worn by men
on the north coast of New Guinea, but not further west
than Cape Bonpland, in this case the hole is in the side
and not at the end as among the Tapiro.</p>

<p>The Negritos are collectors and hunters, and never
cultivate the soil unless they have been modified by
contact with more advanced peoples.</p>

<p>The Andamanese make three kinds of simple huts on
the ground and large communal huts are sometimes
built. The Semang construct “bee-hive” and long
communal huts and weather screens similar to those of
the Andamanese. They also erect tree shelters, but
direct evidence is very scanty that pure Semang inhabit
huts with a flooring raised on piles; they sleep on bamboo
platforms. The Aeta usually make very simple huts
sometimes with a raised bamboo sleeping platform inside.
The pile dwellings of the Tapiro have evidently been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
copied from those of other tribes in the interior. The
Mafulu build a different kind of pile dwelling which has
a peculiar hood-like porch.</p>

<p>All the Negritos have the bow and arrow. The Great
Andamanese bow is peculiar while that of the Little
Andamanese appears to resemble that of the Semang.
The Great Andamanese and the Tapiro have very long
bows. Harpoon arrows with iron points are used by the
Andamanese and Aeta, the arrows of the Andamanese,
Semang and Aeta are nocked, but only those of the two
latter are feathered. No nocked or feathered arrows
occur in New Guinea. Only the Semang and Aeta are
known to poison their arrows, and they may have
borrowed the idea from the poisoned darts of the blow-pipe.
Some Semang have adopted the blow-pipe.</p>

<p>The Andamanese appear to be one of the very few
people who possess fire but do not know how to make
it afresh. The Semang usually make fire by “rubbing
together short blocks of wood, bamboo or cane. A
common method consists in passing a rattan line round
the portion of a dried branch, and holding the branch
down by the feet whilst the line is rapidly worked to
and fro with the hands.” Flint and steel are also used.
(The Sakai employ similar methods.) (<i>Skeat and Blagden</i>,
<span class="smcap">I</span>, pp. 111-114, 119.) Among the Aeta flint and steel
have almost replaced the old method of making fire by
one piece of split bamboo being sawed rapidly across
another piece. Semper collected from Negritos of N.E.
Luzon, a split stick, bark fibre and a strip of rattan
used in fire-making, these are described and figured by
A. B. Meyer (<i>Publ. der K. Ethn. Mus. zu. Dresden</i>, <span class="smcap">IX</span>,
<i>Negritos</i>, p. 5, pl. 11, fig. 7 a-c). It is interesting to find
that the Tapiro employ the same method and apparatus
(p. <a href="#Page_200">200</a>). Thus there occurs among Negritos in the
Philippines and New Guinea the method of making
fire by partly splitting a dry stick, keeping the ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
open by inserting a piece of wood or a stone in the cleft,
stuffing some tinder into the narrow part of the slit and
then drawing rapidly a strip of rattan to and fro across
this spot till a spark ignites the tinder. Pöch found it
among the Poum, dwelling in the mountains inland from
the Kai (<i>Geog. Jnl.</i> <span class="smcap">XXX</span>, 1907, p. 612, and <i>Mitt. Anth. Ges.
in Wien</i>, <span class="smcap">XXXVII.</span> 1907, p. 59, fig. 2, 3). Precisely the
same method was described by the Rev. Dr. W. G. Lawes
who found it among the Koiari of Tabure on Mt. Warirata
(<i>Proc. R. Geog. Soc.</i> <span class="smcap">V</span>, 1883, p. 357). Finsch
collected the apparatus from the same people (<i>Ann.
des K.K. naturhist. Hofmus. in Wien</i>, <span class="smcap">III</span>, 1888, p. 323;
Leo Frobenius, <i>The Childhood of Man</i>, 1909, fig. 313,
but Frobenius is mistaken in representing the rattan
as going twice round the stick). Dr. H. O. Forbes had
found it at Ubumkara on the Naoro, also in the Central
Division (<i>P.R.G.S.</i> <span class="smcap">XII.</span> 1890, p. 562). Mr. C. A. W.
Monckton noticed it in 1906 among the Kambisa tribe,
in the valley of the Chirima, Mt. Albert Edward (<i>Ann.
Rep. Brit. New Guinea</i>, 1907). Pöch suggests that N.
von Miklucho-Maclay was wrong in thinking that the
strip was rubbed in the split of a stick (<i>l.c.</i> p. 61);
this is the earliest Papuan record (1872).</p>

<p>From the above account it is possible that the split
stick and rattan strip method of fire-making may be a
criterion of Negrito culture, but it should be noted that the
stick is not reported as split among the Semang, and that
the unsplit stick is found among the Sakai and the Kayans
and Kenyahs of Sarawak who are not Negritos. Also the
split stick is found at several spots in the mountainous
interior of the south-east peninsula of New Guinea where
Negrito influence has not yet been recorded, but Mr.
Williamson’s observations are very suggestive in this
respect. Pöch (<i>l.c.</i> p. 62) points out that this method is
nearest akin to “fire-sawing with bamboo, both in
principle and distribution,” of which he gives details. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
somewhat similar method is that described by W. E.
Roth. A split hearth-stick is held by the feet, but fire
is made by sawing with another piece of wood, a device
which appears to be widely spread in Queensland and
occurs also on the Lachlan River, N.S.W. (<i>N. Queensland
Ethnogr. Bull.</i> 7, 1904, sect. 9, pl. <span class="smcap">II</span>. figs. 17, 18).</p>

<p>So far as is known the social structure of the Negritos
is very simple. Among the Andamanese there is no
division of the community into two moieties, no clan
system nor totemism, neither has a classificatory system
of kinship been recorded; the social unit appears to be
the family, and the power of the head-man is very
limited. Our knowledge concerning the Semang and
Aeta is extremely imperfect but they probably resemble
the Andamanese in these points. The Andamanese and
Semang are strictly monogamous, polygyny is allowed
among the Aeta, but monogamy prevails. The only
restriction at all on marriage appears to be the prohibition
of marriage between near kindred, and divorce is very
rare. All bury their dead, but it is considered by the
Andamanese more complimentary to place the dead on a
platform which is generally built in a large tree, and the
more honourable practice of the Semang is to expose
the dead in trees. The Mafulu bury ordinary people,
but the corpses of chiefs are placed in an open box either
on a platform or in the fork of a kind of fig tree.
Nothing is known about the social life of the Tapiro,
and Williamson says, “The very simple ideas of the
Mafulu, as compared with the Papuans and Melanesians,
in matters of social organization, implements, arts and
crafts, religion and other things may well, I think, be
associated with a primitive Negrito origin” (<i>l.c.</i> p. 306).</p>

<h3>SHORT BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h3>

<p class="p f085">This is not the place to attempt to give a record of the very voluminous
bibliography of the Negritos, and most of the works here recorded are those from
which the foregoing facts have been collected. Books referred to in the text are,
with one or two exceptions, not here repeated.</p>

<p class="p padl2 f085">Pater W. Schmidt has gone into the whole pygmy question with great
thoroughness. He extends his comparison to the African pygmies
(Negrillos), between whom and the Asiatic pygmies he attempts to prove a
connection through Southern India. Emphasis is laid on the “infantile”
physical characters of both African and Asiatic pygmies and the extremely
primitive features of their culture. He is inclined to regard the Pre-Dravidian
Vedda, Senoi and Toala as of mixed pygmy origin, finding
support for this theory in the proximity of the Senoi to the Semang in the
Malay Peninsula. The eastward extension of the pygmies into Melanesia
and New Guinea is not dealt with.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX C</h2>

<p class="center">NOTES ON LANGUAGES IN THE EAST OF
NETHERLANDS NEW GUINEA</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">By SIDNEY H. RAY, M.A.</span></p>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> considering the languages of Netherlands New Guinea
it is convenient to divide the territory into six geographical
divisions. These are:—</p>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p class="indent2">1. The North-western Coast and Islands (Waigiu,
Salawati, and Misol).</p>

<p class="indent2">2. The Western shore of Geelvink Bay and the islands
adjacent (Mefor, Biak, and Jobi).</p>

<p class="indent2">3. The Peninsula of Kumava (Orange Nassau) with
the islands between Ceram and the Ké group.</p>

<p class="indent2">4. The Southern and Eastern Shores of Geelvink
Bay.</p>

<p class="indent2">5. The North Coast from Kurudu Islands to Humboldt
Bay.</p>

<p class="indent2">6. The South-eastern Coast from Kamrau Inlet to
the Bensbach River on the boundary between
Netherlands and British territory.</p></div>

<p>The present notice only refers to languages in the
three last of these divisions.</p>

<p>At the Western end of the South shore of Geelvink
Bay is the district of Wandammen, of which the language
is fairly well known. For this we have a vocabulary
with grammatical examples (9),<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> and also for Windessi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>which is the same language, a mission text-book. Eastward
from Wandammen the numerals only are recorded
(7), but at the Southern point of the Bay, in the district
around Jamur Lake we have the collections made by
Van der Sande during the Wichmann Expedition of 1903
(8). He gives a vocabulary of Angadi, an island in the
Jamur Lake, some words of the Nagramadu dialect on
the North-west, and the numerals of Goreda on the South
of the lake. The languages of the Western Shore of
Geelvink Bay are represented only by numerals (7) but
there is more information of the language of Pauwi at the
mouth of the Wamberam or Amberno or Mamberamo
River, where F. van Braam Morris collected a vocabulary
published by Robidé van der Aa in 1885 (6). This was
considered faulty by de Clercq.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Westward along the Northern coast very little
linguistic material is available, and the few words recorded
show great differences. The places of which the
speech is known are, on the mainland: Takar, Tarfia and
Tana Merah, and on the islands: Liki (in the Kumamba
Group), Moar (called also Wakde), Masimasi and Jamna
(4, 5).</p>

<p>For the region about Humboldt Bay we have short
vocabularies of Jotafa by various collectors, and a fuller
one by G. L. Bink (2), also Sentani lists by P. E. Moolenburg
(3) and van der Sande (8). Moolenburg also gives
a list from Seka, West of the Bay.</p>

<p>For the Southern shore of Netherlands New Guinea,
we have nothing but vocabularies, none of very large
extent, the most extensive being that of Merauke in the
extreme West (15) which has also been ably discussed by
Dr. N. Adriani.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Commencing at Kamrau Inlet, the languages of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>shore and islands are illustrated by the Kowiai vocabularies
of Miklucho-Maclay (13), the papers of G. W. Earl<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
and the lists of S. Muller (10), the last two being derived
from the collections made during the voyage of the
<i>Triton</i> under Lieut. Modera in 1828. The following
languages are named:—</p>

<p class="p f09 padl2">
Lobo at Triton Bay (including Namatote, Aiduma, Mawara, and Kaju-Mera).<br />
Wuaussirau, inland on the Kamaka-Wallar Lake.<br />
Mairassis, inland from Lobo.<br />
Lakahia, on Telok Lakahia.<br />
Kiruru, on Telok Kiruru.<br />
Utanata, on the Utanata River.
</p>

<p>Westward of the Utanata a vocabulary of the language
spoken on the Mimika River people was obtained by Mr.
Wollaston in 1910-11. A list of the same language is
given also in the account of the South-west New Guinea
Expedition of the Royal Netherlands Geographical
Association.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The latter work contains a few words of
the language used at the mouth of the Kupĕra Pukwa
River.</p>

<p>The language of Mĕraukĕ has been recorded by J.
Seijne Kok (15), and by J. C. Montague and E. F. Bik,[C]
that of Toro by S. Bik.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<h3>II.  CLASSIFICATION OF THE LANGUAGES.</h3>

<p>Of the three languages in the northern part of Eastern
Netherlands New Guinea that of the Jotafa of Humboldt
Bay has been ably discussed by Dr. Kern,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> who
decides that in phonology, construction, numeration and
word store it presents many points of agreement with
the Mefoor or Nufōr of the North-west. But it undoubtedly
also contains many words which are of non-Indonesian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
origin. The Sentani and Pawi languages
seem to have very few or no words similar to the
Indonesian, and may probably be found to be Papuan
languages. But nothing is known of the grammar. The
language of Wandammen presents agreements with the
Mefoor (or Nufōr) in vocabulary and also in some points
of grammar. It will probably be found to fall into the
same class as the Nufōr and Jotafa. The languages of
the north coast and islands also show a mixture of
Indonesian with other words. So little is known of the
structure of the languages in the Kumava Peninsula that
their place cannot be determined with certainty. The
numerals and much of the vocabulary appear to be
Indonesian,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> but there are Papuan forms in the
Grammar.</p>

<p>The Lobo languages of the Kowiai district on the
south coast appear to be Indonesian, but those inland
and south of Geelvink Bay have a distinct connection
with those on the south coast west of the Kowiai district,
and with those at the Utanata River and beyond the
Mimika, at least as far as the Kupera Pukwa River.
Beyond this point nothing is recorded until Princess
Marianne Strait is reached, and here of two words
known, one is Mĕraukĕ.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The latter language extends
to the Boundary. All west of the Lobo appear to be
Papuan.</p>

<p>Using the scanty means available, the languages of
the Eastern part of Netherlands New Guinea may be
thus provisionally classified:—</p>

<p>5.  <i>Construction.</i></p>

<p>A few grammatical forms which appear to be indicated
in the vocabularies may be noted here.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The possessive with pronouns and pronominal
words is indicated by a suffix <i>-ta</i>. Mimika, <i>doro-ta</i>, of
me, mine; <i>oro-ta</i>, thine; <i>amare-ta</i>, his; <i>wehwaída-ta</i>, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>another man. In Angadi several compound words end
in <i>nata</i>, which thus appears to be a noun, <i>na</i> (thing?),
with the possessive suffix; and it seems possible to
explain such words as <i>ută-nata</i>, firewood; <i>kara nata</i>,
head of javelin—<i>i.e.</i> fire-thing-of, javelin-thing-of. Cf.
also <i>nata pairi</i> given by v. d. Sande for “skin,” with
Mimika <i>pīgīri</i>, skin, which suggests that <i>nata pairi</i> means
skin of something.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The adjective follows the noun. Utanata <i>warari
napetike</i>, water big, river.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> A noun in the genitive relation precedes its substantive.
Mimika <i>bau mame</i>, leg’s eye, ankle; <i>iwau
makarĕ</i>, belly’s band. Angadi <i>mahare hehe</i>, finger nail;
<i>māū hehe</i>, toe nail; <i>mirimoi ipa</i>, nose hole, nostril; <i>ihani
ipa</i>, hole in ear lobe; <i>ămore eme</i>, bow’s rattan, bowstring.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> The subject precedes the verb. Angadi <i>jăū hinau-mara</i>,
sun rises (?), morning; <i>jăū emapojemia</i>, sun sets (?),
evening.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> The object also precedes the verb. Angadi <i>ihani
aimeri</i>, ear pierce; <i>mirimoi aimeri</i>, nose pierce.</p>

<p>These five points indicate a Papuan structure of the
languages.</p>

<p>6. <i>Comparison with Merauke and the Languages of British
New Guinea West of the Fly River.</i></p>

<p>The Papuan languages usually show so few agreements
in vocabulary that the likeness of words, unless
frequent, cannot be held to establish relationship. In
the comparative vocabulary, words and numerals are
added from the languages on British Territory.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> These
show a few likenesses, which may, however, be accidental.</p>

<h3>IV.  MALAYAN INFLUENCE ON THE SOUTH COAST OF
NETHERLANDS NEW GUINEA.</h3>

<p>In a discussion of the languages of the south-eastern
shores of Netherlands New Guinea, the extent of Malay
influence in that region must be taken into account.
Mr. William Churchill has lately put forward a theory
that the Polynesian people entered the Pacific not only
by coasting along the northern shores of New Guinea to
the Solomon Group, but also by a passage through Torres
Straits, and thence along the south-eastern coast of
British New Guinea to the New Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> On tracing
the languages westward from Polynesia, it is an indisputable
fact that many words which are identical with Polynesian
are found in use along the shores of British New
Guinea, though they are not used in a Polynesian syntax,
or in the simplified forms usual in the Eastern tongues.
It is also a fact that many of these same words are
current also in the western islands of Indonesia. For
example, <i>hua</i>, fruit; <i>ina</i>, mother; <i>lala</i>, blood; <i>lau</i>, leaf;
<i>au</i>, I; <i>ruma</i>, house; <i>inu</i>, drink; <i>utu</i>, louse; <i>tohu</i>, sugar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>cane, and many other words are identical in the south-east
of British New Guinea and in Ceram. But in
British New Guinea the languages which show likeness
to Polynesian end abruptly at Cape Possession, and are
not found west of that point.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Hence it becomes important
to inquire how far the similar tongues of Amboyna
and Ceram have influenced the New Guinea languages to
the east of them. That there is such an influence is
plain from the vocabularies of the languages. Indonesian
words, such as the Onin (10) <i>kayu</i>, wood; <i>tanigan</i>,
ear; <i>nifan</i>, tooth; <i>fenu</i>, turtle; <i>mani</i>, bird; <i>afi</i>, fire, are
of common occurrence in the islands of the Arafura Sea,
and on the coast of the mainland. But these words are
more common in the west, and gradually disappear
towards Torres Straits, and are not found beyond. In
Rosenberg’s Karufa list (12) we find such characteristically
Indonesian words as <i>ulu</i>, hair; <i>mata</i>, eye; <i>uhru</i>,
mouth; <i>taruya</i>, ear; <i>nima</i>, hand; <i>ora</i>, sun; <i>uran</i>, moon;
<i>niyu</i>, coconut. Words of this kind are found also in
Lobo (10) and Namatote (13), as, for example, <i>wuran</i>,
moon; <i>labi</i>, fire; <i>nima</i>, hand; <i>nena</i>, mother; <i>rara</i>,
blood; <i>metan</i>, black; <i>tobu</i>, sugar cane; <i>wosa</i>, paddle;
<i>matoran</i>, sit; <i>mariri</i>, stand. Some of these words seem
to have passed into Utanata (10) and Lakahia (13), and
apparently, though not so freely, into Wuaussirau (13),
Mairassis (10), and Mimika (14). The Kiruru vocabulary
of Maclay does not appear to show any words of this
kind. The following are examples of Indonesian or
Ceram words in the Utanata-Mimika group of languages.</p>

<div class="blockquot2">
<p class="indent">Utanata <i>uran</i>, Lakahia <i>bura</i>, Mairassis <i>furan</i>, Mimika <i>pura</i>, Ceram <i>wulana</i>,
moon. The Angadi has also <i>pura</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Lakahia <i>bugura</i>, Wuaussirau <i>wara</i>, Mimika <i>pukare</i>, Ceram <i>uhara</i>, mountain.
Utanata has <i>pamogo</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Utanata <i>pō</i>, Lakahia <i>boa</i>, Mimika <i>poh</i>, Ceram <i>wosa</i>, paddle.</p>

<p class="indent">Utanata <i>kai</i>, Ceram <i>kai</i>, wood. For this the Mimika is <i>uti</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>A word of much interest in this region is <i>turika</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>or <i>turi</i>. This is given by Muller in his Ceram list as
<i>turika</i>, knife, in Lobo <i>turi</i>, Onin <i>tuni</i>. Maclay gives the
Ceram (Keffing) as <i>turito</i>, Namatote and Wuaussirau <i>turi</i>,
also for “knife.” The word does not appear in Angadi
or in the list of Ekris (19). Though not apparently used
in Merauke <i>turik</i> has travelled eastward as far as Torres
Straits and the Fly River, and even to the borders of the
Papuan Gulf. Thus Bangu <i>turik</i>, Dabu <i>turikata</i>, Sisiami
(Bamu R.) <i>turuko</i>, and Tirio <i>turuko</i> mean “knife” (<i>i.e.</i> iron
knife). In Bugi, Saibai, Mowata and Kiwai, <i>turika</i> and
in Murray Island <i>tulik</i> mean “iron.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Dr. N. Adriani has pointed out some words adopted
from Malay in Merauke and also some apparent agreements
between that language and Indonesian languages
generally,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> but there is no evidence of any language from
Ceram having passed through the Torres Straits. Agreements
between the Merauke and Papuan languages to the
east are also pointed out by Dr. Adriani<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> but these are no
evidence of the passage of a Polynesian fleet, as they
are not Polynesian words, and the languages using them
have no Polynesian syntax. Mr. Churchill’s theory of
the Polynesian entry into the Pacific by way of Torres
Straits cannot therefore be maintained.</p>

out the interesting fact that this custom of shedding tears in welcome

among the Andamanese and other Negroid inhabitants of South-Eastern
Asia and Australasia.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be

distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
